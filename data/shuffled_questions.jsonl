{"question":"You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. 5th Grade Science Semester 2 Knowledge Outline\n\n## Unit 1: Heart and Brain\n### Lesson 1: Our Brain\n1. The brain is the \"command center\" of the human body, directing human actions, generating thoughts and emotions, and performing cognition and decision-making. The brain controls human behavior and emotions.\n2. The brain is divided into three parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. The cerebrum is divided into left and right hemispheres. Different regions have different functions.\n3. Our brain has sensory centers, auditory centers, motor centers, and visual centers.\n4. We can think, judge, and experience emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, and joy. This is the brain at work.\n\n### Lesson 2: The Nervous System\n1. The nervous system includes the brain, peripheral nerves, and spinal cord.\n2. Nerves are the body's \"telephone lines,\" capable of promptly reporting information obtained from various parts of the body to the brain, and transmitting commands from the brain to various parts of the body.\n3. After the starting gun fires, an athlete's ears receive the sound stimulus, the auditory nerve transmits the signal to the brain, the brain determines it's the starting signal, sends commands through nerves to the muscles, and the athlete begins to run.\n4. If a finger is suddenly pricked by a sharp object, we withdraw our hand first, then feel the pain.\n\n### Lesson 3: Protecting the Brain\n1. The brain is a vital organ of the human body.\n2. How does the human body protect the brain?\n   Answer: ①The skull, similar to a walnut shell, protects the brain. ②There are membranes between the skull and brain tissue that protect and support brain tissue. ③Yawning is a brief self-protective method for the brain to increase blood oxygen levels.\n3. How can we protect our brain?\n   Answer: ①Adequate sleep; ②Alternating between different subjects when studying; ③Appropriate physical exercise; ④No smoking or excessive drinking; ⑤Wearing helmets when cycling.\n\n### Lesson 4: Heart and Blood Vessels\n1. Heart rates differ by age. For children and adolescents under normal circumstances, the heart beats 60 to 100 times per minute.\n2. Heart rate is the number of heartbeats per minute. Pulse rate is the number of arterial pulsations per minute. Under normal circumstances, a person's pulse rate and heart rate are the same.\n3. The heart is located on the left side of the chest cavity, shaped like an inverted pear, larger at the top and smaller at the bottom, approximately the size of one's fist. The heart has four chambers: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle.\n4. Blood vessels are divided into arteries, veins, and capillaries.\n5. Each time the heart contracts and relaxes, we feel one heartbeat. Typically, the heart pumps about 70ml of blood with each beat.\n6. How to protect our heart and blood vessels?\n   Answer: ①Daily outdoor exercise; ②Calm emotions and positive outlook; ③Balanced diet and moderate eating habits.\n\n### Lesson 5: Our Health Records\n1. Establishing health records helps us understand our physical health status and prevent and treat diseases in a timely manner.\n2. The WHO has outlined indicators of human health:\n   (1) Mental vitality, able to cope with daily life and work calmly.\n   (2) Positive attitude, optimistic outlook, willingness to take responsibility, non-critical.\n   (3) Ability to rest well, good sleep quality.\n   (4) Strong adaptability, able to adjust to various environmental changes.\n   (5) Certain resistance to common colds and infectious diseases.\n   (6) Appropriate weight, proportionate physique.\n   (7) Bright eyes, quick reactions, no eyelid inflammation.\n   (8) Clean, undamaged teeth, gums that don't bleed.\n   (9) Lustrous hair without dandruff.\n   (10) Radiant and elastic skin, walking with ease and vitality.\n\nPlease generate a game code with 40 challenge questions based on this content. The game code should be able to run offline. The game background should be light blue.","index":349}

{"question":"You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Class Teacher Simulator\n\n## Basic Mechanisms\n\n1. Time Setting\n\n* Each academic year is divided into spring and fall semesters, with five teaching days per week. The last week of the semester is for exams and parent-teacher conferences.\n* As the head teacher, you have 8 action points to allocate each day (can be increased later based on physical condition). Mandatory action points include morning and evening self-study sessions and teaching your own subject classes.\n\nMorning and evening self-study options: independent study or specific subject study.\n\nTeaching your own subject requires increasing lesson preparation to improve teaching quality.\n\nOther action points can be used for: auditing classes, lesson preparation, discussing class situations with other teachers, grading assignments, etc.\n\nWeekends allow free actions, with Sunday evening mandating class schedule planning. Winter and summer breaks may trigger special events (such as home visit crises, romance storylines, etc.)\n\n2. Main Character and Teacher Attribute Growth\n\nRandomly generated subject teachers with different personalities and attributes trigger different events.\n\n* Intelligence determines lesson preparation efficiency and problem-solving ability.\n* Charisma affects class officer loyalty and parent communication success rate, can be improved through hosting class meetings or participating in public lessons.\n* Subject expertise is locked to your initially chosen teaching subject (e.g., Chinese language teachers have ancient text analysis privileges).\n* Physical strength limits daily action count; continuing work after 1 AM will trigger a blood-coughing event.\n* When health falls below 30, you may collapse at the lectern, forcing a three-day hospitalization and missing critical teaching progress.\n* Emotional intelligence is used to resolve student conflicts; high EQ individuals can unlock the hidden \"Soul Dialogue\" option.\n\n## Class Ecosystem\n\n1. Student Generation System\n\n40 students randomly generated with the following trait combinations:\n\n* Family background: Single-parent families, wealthy second-generation, intellectual families, etc. (over 10 types of family situations).\n* Subject grades: Nine independent values (main subjects fluctuate ±5%, minor subjects ±10%)\n* Charisma and emotional intelligence: Affects students' interpersonal networks, triggering friendship/conflict/romance events\n* Diligence and talent: Affects learning efficiency and subject performance.\n   - Daily adjustments based on personality, mood, class atmosphere, family situation, etc.\n   - Below 40 triggers \"lying flat mode\" (homework completion rate plummets)\n\nAttribute linking formula:\nSingle subject improvement = (Talent×0.3 + Diligence×0.7) × Teacher subject expertise modifier\nPsychological breakdown probability = (Family pressure + Class average pressure) ÷ Student's EQ\n\n2. Class Committee System\n\nAppoint class officers at the beginning of each semester, with options for appointment or class election. Class officers include: class monitor, deputy monitor, study representative, arts and entertainment representative, labor representative, publicity representative, organizational representative, and subject representatives. Different combinations trigger different chain reactions.\n\nFree Day Mechanism\n\n* Saturday-Sunday: Teacher's free actions (consuming physical strength)\n   - Home visits (must match student family type: single-parent families require EQ ≥60)\n   - Self-improvement (library +Intelligence/gym +Health)\n   - Unexpected events (15% probability of events like \"student running away from home\")\n\n* Sunday evening: Mandatory class schedule arrangement\n\nClass Schedule System\n\n* Resource balance:\n   - Main subjects >60% → Triggers \"homework overload protest\" event (next day efficiency -20%)\n   - Interest classes for two consecutive days → Principal's warning about \"not focusing on proper teaching\"\n\n## Events and Choices\n\n1. 40+ Daily Random Events\n\n* Pink envelope: When discovering love letters, choosing \"tear up publicly\" will cause the couple to elope; choosing \"anonymous counseling\" might foster a top student couple.\n* Cheating storm: Catching mass cheating during exam supervision—severe punishment loses the class's red flag award, overlooking it plants landmines for college entrance exams.\n\n2. Competition Arena\n\n* Competition pyramid\n* Basic level: School exams affect class ranking in the grade, monthly tests (affect class ranking and next month's learning efficiency), midterm and final exams (affect ranking, parents' and school leaders' attitudes, overall class atmosphere)\n   - Academic Olympiad competitions\n   - National New Concept Writing Competition\n\n3. Campus Carnival\n\n* Spring Sports Meet:\n   - Hidden attribute \"Sportsmanship\" determines ranking (not purely physical ability)\n\n* New Year's Arts Performance:\n   - Winning brings special funding from the principal\n\n## Endings and Evaluation\n\nCollege Entrance Exam System\n\nFinal results are determined by \"Basic Strength\" (subject values), \"On-site Luck\" (hidden random number), and \"Psychological Pressure Resistance\" (stress value conversion), with possible dramatic reversals like \"God Mode\" (30% overperformance) or \"Ten years of study ruined in one day\" (key subject failure).\n\nCollege Entrance Exam Results Night generates a \"Life Trajectory Map\":\n\n* Worldly Success: Number of students admitted to Tsinghua/Peking University, percentage of top-tier university admissions, competition medals.\n* Hidden Costs: Number of psychologically traumatized students, stifled geniuses, \"defective products\" eliminated by the system.\n* Teacher Evaluation: 57 possible endings from \"Incompetent talent ruining students' futures\" to \"Educational Revolutionary,\" revealing your true educational philosophy.\n\nInterface is code-box style, preserving basic attributes, schedules and time. JavaScript interface with window-like modules. All text and emojis within the code box! Within the code window!! But omitting actual code!!! Only showing the core module text content inside the code box.\n\nSetting is realistic, no fantasy, tech, or supernatural elements allowed in the game. No mysterious events. All character behavior logic matches reality. Game progresses by action points without skipping. Next action only after current action is scheduled.\n\nNow generating main character: Head Teacher Jiang Ruoyao, female, 24, subject expertise in Chinese language. Time: New semester of high school freshman year.","index":279}

We need a dynastic family simulation game set in ancient times with a fictional background. Avoid fantasy superpowers, blood, horror, or overly dark themes.

Fifth Grade Science Textbook Knowledge Outline - Second Semester\n\n## Unit 1: Heart and Brain\n### Lesson 1: Our Brain\n1. The brain is the \"command center\" of the human body, directing human actions, generating thoughts and emotions, and carrying out cognition and decision-making. The brain controls human behavior and emotions.\n2. The brain is divided into three parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. The cerebrum is divided into left and right hemispheres. Different areas have different functions.\n3. Our brain has sensory centers, auditory centers, motor centers, and visual centers.\n4. We can think, make judgments, and experience emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, and joy. This is the brain at work.\n\n### Lesson 2: The Nervous System\n1. The nervous system includes the brain, peripheral nerves, and spinal cord.\n2. Nerves are the body's \"telephone lines,\" capable of promptly reporting information obtained from various parts of the body to the brain, and transmitting commands from the brain to different parts of the body.\n3. After a starting gun fires, an athlete's ears receive the sound stimulus, the auditory nerve transmits the signal to the brain, the brain identifies it as the starting signal, and sends commands through nerves to the muscles, causing the athlete to begin running.\n4. If a finger is suddenly pricked by a sharp object, we withdraw our hand first, then feel the pain.\n\n### Lesson 3: Protecting the Brain\n1. The brain is an important organ of the human body.\n2. How does the human body protect the brain?\n   Answer: ① The skull, similar to a walnut shell, protects the brain. ② There are membranes between the skull and brain tissue that protect and support brain tissue. ③ Yawning is a brief self-protective measure that increases the brain's oxygen content.\n3. How can we protect our brain?\n   Answer: ① Adequate sleep; ② Alternating between different subjects when studying; ③ Appropriate physical exercise; ④ Not smoking or drinking excessively; ⑤ Wearing helmets when cycling.\n\n### Lesson 4: Heart and Blood Vessels\n1. People of different ages have different heart rates. Under normal circumstances, children and adolescents have 60 to 100 heartbeats per minute.\n2. Heart rate refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute. Pulse rate refers to the number of times arteries pulsate per minute. Under normal circumstances, a person's pulse rate matches their heart rate.\n3. The heart is located on the left side of the chest cavity, shaped like an inverted pear, larger at the top and smaller at the bottom, about the size of one's fist. The heart has four chambers: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle.\n4. Blood vessels are categorized as arteries, veins, and capillaries.\n5. With each contraction and relaxation of the heart, we feel one heartbeat. Generally, the heart pumps about 70ml of blood with each beat.\n6. How do we protect our heart and blood vessels?\n   Answer: ① Daily outdoor exercise; ② Maintaining a calm, optimistic attitude; ③ Balanced diet and moderate eating habits.\n\n### Lesson 5: Our Health Records\n1. Establishing health records helps us understand our physical health condition and prevent diseases in a timely manner.\n2. The WHO has proposed that a healthy person exhibits:\n   (1) Abundant energy, handling daily life and work with composure.\n   (2) Positive attitude, optimism, willingness to take responsibility, and not being picky.\n   (3) Good at resting with quality sleep.\n   (4) Strong adaptability to various environmental changes.\n   (5) Certain resistance to common colds and infectious diseases.\n   (6) Appropriate weight and balanced physique.\n   (7) Bright eyes, quick reactions, and no eyelid inflammation.\n   (8) Clean, undamaged teeth with gums that don't bleed.\n   (9) Lustrous hair without dandruff.\n   (10) Glowing skin with elasticity, walking with ease and vitality.\n\nBased on the above text, please generate an offline game code containing 50 checkpoint questions that can help fifth-grade students better master the knowledge points through gameplay.","index":255}

Create an entertaining and fun KET vocabulary game HTML page for elementary school students that can help children strengthen their memory in word pronunciation and spelling. The requirements are as follows:\n\n1. The page should include learning mode, practice mode, and test mode, incorporating game elements that are highly interactive, entertaining, and challenging.\n2. When the program starts, a popup should prompt the user to load vocabulary words. The user selects a text file containing words saved in TXT format, separated by commas.\n3. After loading the TXT file, the program generates a word card for each word, including a corresponding emoji, phonetic symbol, hidden Chinese explanation (which can be viewed by clicking), and common phrases related to the word.\n4. In learning mode, students study the word cards. Pronunciation should be available in both British and American accents, with adjustable playback speed from 0.5x to 1.5x.\n5. In practice mode, students can practice word spelling, fill-in-the-blank exercises, and dictation to reinforce vocabulary memorization (for spelling practice, the letters of the word can be scrambled, requiring children to click on the letters in the correct order).\n6. In test mode, students take dictation and complete fill-in-the-blank application exercises to check their mastery of vocabulary, avoiding Chinese prompts as much as possible.\n7. Upon successful completion of challenges, encouraging language and fun animations like thumbs-up, fireworks, little stars, rockets, etc. appear. If wrong answers are given, animations like bombs or \"oops\" expressions appear with messages to keep trying.\n7. The layout should be centered, with compatibility considerations to ensure normal use on mobile phones. Words should be displayed in standard print font.\n8. Word information should be configured through a separate JSON file, achieving separation of data and code.\n9. After code generation, review it to ensure all features and buttons are functional without errors.","index":342}

In this problem, we specify the board size as 11×11.\n• Both sides take turns placing pieces continuously. Once placed on the board, chess pieces cannot be moved or removed.\n• The red side (the letter side in the coordinate system mentioned later) goes first.\n• Since Hex has a significant first-mover advantage, we introduce the pie rule: after the first piece is placed, the opponent can choose to swap this piece for their own and place it at a position symmetrical to the original position along the diagonal of the board. First and second players are randomly determined.\n• The side that connects the opposite sides of the board with pieces of the same color wins. Please regenerate the .js code according to these rules.","index":1325}

Nezha is the protagonist in the animated films \"Ne Zha: Birth of the Demon Child\" and \"Ne Zha: The Devil Child Returns to the Sea\" directed by Jiaozi, as well as related works.\n\nNezha is the third son of Li Jing and Lady Yin. He has a rebellious, mischievous, and impulsive personality, yet remains kind and just. Because he was reincarnated from a demon pill, he is misunderstood by people, feels lonely inside, and craves acceptance.\n\nHe has straight bangs, two small buns on top of his head, large panda eyes with heavy eye makeup, and somewhat frightening rows of teeth. He often displays a wicked smile with a hint of cuteness. He wears a golden collar around his neck, a red vest with lotus patterns, brown three-quarter length pants with flame patterns, and a yellow belt. He is a chaotic \"demon child\" who mistakenly came to the mortal world causing endless trouble. At birth, because the spirit pearl was stolen by Shen Gongbao, he became the reincarnation of the demon pill. Initially, Nezha faced discrimination, rejection, mockery, and hostility from the people of Chentang Pass because he was a demon pill, but as the story progresses, he gradually gains acceptance from the people.\n\nPlease use CSS preprocessing to create two files based on the text above: one HTML file and one LESS file.","index":1621}

{"question":"You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. I am refining my master's thesis, which mainly focuses on: exploring user needs through multiple dimensions and designing responses accordingly. The primary method involves analyzing user interview records and online review data using text data analysis to understand users' basic requirements for customized furniture, and on this basis, conducting research on both structural and aesthetic aspects of customized furniture configuration design. For the structural module configuration of customized furniture, association rule mining algorithms are used to deeply extract component association rules from the company's historical sales records, thereby building a rule base for customized furniture component configuration and forming customized furniture configuration modules categorized by functionality. For the aesthetic configuration design of customized furniture, eye-tracking experiments are conducted to study users' intuitive search mechanisms when observing customized furniture in both single-element stimuli and composite scene stimuli, and to classify users according to their subjective style preferences and objective visual preferences. Finally, combining the results of structural and aesthetic configuration design research, a recommendation system for customized furniture configuration design is built based on a rule engine. Currently, I have reached the system-building stage and plan to present it as a WeChat Mini Program. I have already registered with APPAid. As I have no coding background, I need specific and detailed implementation guidance from the beginning. My current plan for the Mini Program consists of eight steps: 1. User selects the required cabinet function, including wardrobe, entrance cabinet, sideboard, bookcase, storage cabinet, and display cabinet. 2. User selects the number of cabinet units needed: 1, 2, 3, or 4 units. 3. User selects the structural form for each unit, which are pre-established 3D models. 4. Multiple units are combined to display the result. 5. User selects preferred styles, with options including natural, bright, minimalist, vintage, warm, comfortable, and modern, and can select two. 6. Based on the selected styles, recommend colors or textures for the cabinet and map them to the 3D model. 7. Display the result with 3D rotation interaction capability. 8. If unsatisfied, allow further customization of colors and textures.","index":418}

{"question":"You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Who is the Bull King\n\n\"Who is the Bull King\" is a simple and fun card game suitable for 2-10 players. The game consists of 104 cards, each with numbers from 1 to 104, and each card features a different number of bull heads. This game has won multiple awards, including the 1994 German Players' Award and the 1996 Best Mind Game Award.\n\n## Game Rules\n\n**Dealing**: Each player receives 10 cards, with 4 cards placed face-up on the table as the initial tableau. Excess cards are discarded.\n\n**Playing**: At the beginning of each round, each player selects one card from their hand to play face-down.\n\n**Card Placement Order**: When all players have placed their cards face-down, the system automatically reveals and places the cards, starting with the card closest in value to the last card on the tableau. If cards are equally close, the smaller card is placed first.\n\n**Placement Rules**: Cards are preferentially placed in positions that don't require collecting cards, then in positions closest to the end card on the tableau, and finally in positions where the end card has a smaller value.\n\n**Card Collection**: When a player places a card that is smaller than the last card on the tableau, or when placing a card in the sixth position, they must collect all the previous cards and their played card becomes the new first card on the tableau.\n\n**Game End**: There are two ways to end the game, chosen by players: either when all cards from players' hands have been played, or when a player reaches 66 bull heads.\n\n## Card Quantities\nIf there are fewer than 10 players, reduce the deck size by 20 cards for every 4 fewer players. For 7-10 players, use cards 1-104; for 3-6 players, use cards 1-84; for 2 players, use cards 1-64.","index":1105}
