Check if contentEditable is properly utilized or if a custom implementation handles key events. Score 0 if basic text editing is missing, 5 if only simple text entry works, and 10 if all standard editing operations are fully implemented.",

Assess whether the document model maintains a proper hierarchical structure rather than just styling text.

Test if the editor prevents data loss during unexpected operations or crashes. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these scenarios, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to word processing (e.g., built-in games or unrelated tools) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (excessive animations or transitions). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
