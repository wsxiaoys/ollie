      "title": "Is the core game mechanics of airplane shooting fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements player movement, shooting mechanics, enemy generation, and collision detection. Score 0 if the core gameplay is not implemented, 5 points if only basic movement and shooting exists, and 10 points if the game includes varying enemy types, different weapons, and proper game difficulty progression.",

      "description": "Check whether the game uses appropriate images for the player airplane, enemies, bullets, explosions, and background. Evaluate image quality, animation smoothness, and visual feedback. Deduct 3 points if images are missing or placeholder graphics are used, 3 points if animations are jerky, and 3 points if visual feedback for events (hits, explosions, power-ups) is inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the code includes proper game loop implementation (requestAnimationFrame or similar), game states (start screen, playing, game over), score tracking, and level progression. Deduct 5 points if the game loop causes performance issues, 3 points if game states are incomplete, and 3 points if score/level management is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the game implements responsive keyboard/mouse controls for the airplane, with proper event handling for multiple simultaneous inputs. Evaluate if touch controls are included for mobile devices. Deduct 5 points if controls are laggy or unresponsive, 3 points if only keyboard or only mouse control is implemented, and 5 points if mobile touch support is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as window resizing, browser tab switching, input device disconnection, etc.) and provide friendly error handling or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Dynamic difficulty adjustment 4. Particle effects for visual flair). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple collision detection algorithms) 2. Function modules unrelated to the airplane game (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that cause lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code lacks comments or documentation.

Deduct 3 points for each cluttered UI element, 5 points for poor visual hierarchy, and 5 points for text that is difficult to read during gameplay. The full score is 10 points.",
