  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable when possible. Implement a first-person shooter game where the player controls the view direction with the mouse and fires bullets by clicking. The scene will have both static and dynamic obstacles, with bullets able to penetrate some obstacles. Enemies will appear from random locations and approach the player. The player needs to destroy all enemies to advance to the next level.",

      "description": "Check if the code accurately implements first-person camera mechanics with proper quaternion rotation for smooth view transitions. The mouse should control both horizontal (yaw) and vertical (pitch) camera rotations with configurable sensitivity. Verify that pitch constraints prevent camera flipping (typically -89° to 89° pitch limit). Give 5 points for basic mouse look implementation, 8 points if it includes smooth damping, and 10 points if it also handles edge cases like frame rate independence and has proper constraints.",

Check for proper mouse click handling, cooldown/rate of fire implementation, and recoil effects. The shooting should include proper collision detection with different obstacle types.

The code should distinguish between penetrable and non-penetrable obstacles, with appropriate visual and physical properties for each. Check if bullet penetration mechanics include factors like material types, thickness, bullet velocity degradation, and potential trajectory changes.
