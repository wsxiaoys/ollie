Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement an \"Aerial Attack\" game where players can attack in the air, striking airborne enemies or targets.\n\n**Task**: Design an aerial attack system where players can perform attacks in the air to strike airborne enemies or targets.\n\n**Hint**: You can set the range and effect of aerial attacks, and design levels that require aerial combat.\n\nPlease add some comments in your code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",

Score 0 if core aerial mechanics are absent, 5 points if basic aerial movement exists without proper attack mechanics, and 10 points if the implementation includes intuitive aerial controls with responsive attack systems.",

Check if enemies have different behaviors, heights, and attack patterns requiring aerial strategy. Deduct 5 points if enemies are only ground-based, 3 points if aerial enemies exist but lack varied behavior. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the game provides opportunities and incentives for aerial attacks rather than just ground combat. Deduct 5 points if the game can be completed entirely on the ground, and 3 points if aerial sections feel disconnected from the core gameplay. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if there are special rewards for aerial combat prowess or combo systems that encourage mastery of aerial mechanics.

Function modules unrelated to aerial combat (e.g., an unnecessary inventory system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects during standard attacks).
