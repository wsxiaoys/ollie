  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Ensure that the code you generate is executable when possible. Please develop a sandbox-style shooting game editor. Players can design their own shooting levels in the editor, place enemies, obstacles, and props, and set level objectives. After completing the editing, they can test and share their game. The editor supports drag-and-drop operations, property adjustments, and level saving functionality.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements a complete canvas-based editor with drag-and-drop functionality for game elements (enemies, obstacles, props). Check if the editor includes a coordinate system, element selection, movement, and resizing capabilities. Score 0 if the core editor functionality is missing, 5 if only basic placement is implemented, and 10 if the editor offers comprehensive design capabilities including layers, grouping, and alignment tools.",

Check if properties include basic attributes (position, size, appearance) and behavior parameters (enemy movement patterns, health points, damage values, collision responses). Deduct 3 points if visual feedback is missing when adjusting properties, 3 points if common properties require manual input rather than sliders/dropdowns, and 5 points if behavior scripting/configuration is absent.

Check for seamless switching between edit and play modes, real-time debugging tools, and the ability to pause/resume testing. Deduct 5 points if the game physics in test mode differs from final export, 3 points if there's no visual feedback for collisions/interactions during testing, and 5 points if performance diagnostics are missing.

Check if levels are properly serialized/deserialized, whether the code includes versioning support for backward compatibility, and if export options include shareable formats. Deduct 5 points if there's no auto-save feature, 3 points if sharing requires manual file handling, and 5 points if imported levels lose custom properties. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the shooting game editor (e.g., built-in image editor when simple property controls would suffice) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects in the editor interface).
