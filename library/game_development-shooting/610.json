  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Implement a shooting game where players control a mech that moves around the battlefield and shoots enemies. The mech can transform into flight mode, which increases movement speed but reduces attack power. The battlefield has varying terrain heights that affect player visibility and bullet trajectories.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the mech's ground and flight movement mechanics. Check for: 1) smooth transition animations between modes, 2) appropriate speed differences between modes, 3) proper collision detection with terrain, and 4) responsive controls. Score 0 if basic movement is missing, 5 if only basic movement without transformation is implemented, and 10 if both modes with proper physics and transitions are fully included.",

Deduct 3 points if attack power doesn't vary between modes, 5 points if bullet trajectories don't account for terrain, and 3 points if hit detection is inaccurate. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points if enemies have no varied behaviors, 3 points if they don't interact with terrain, and 4 points if spawn patterns are random or overwhelming. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the game premise (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that cause frame rate drops).
