  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure any code you generate is executable. Develop a terrain destruction shooting game that uses Perlin noise to generate random terrain. When bullets hit the terrain, they should create realistic depressions and deformations, allowing players to destroy enemies behind cover. Implement fluid simulation: breaking water containers should release water that affects the movement speed of both players and enemies. Use WebGL to render advanced terrain effects.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code correctly implements Perlin noise to generate random terrain with natural-looking variations. Check if the implementation includes multiple octaves for detail, proper frequency/amplitude settings, and terrain height normalization. Score 0 if Perlin noise is not implemented, 5 if basic implementation exists but lacks parameter tuning, and 10 if the terrain generation produces diverse, natural-looking landscapes with configurable parameters.",

      "description": "Review how bullets interact with the terrain. Check if pixel-perfect or physics-based collision detection is implemented, whether destruction creates proper deformations with debris effects, and if the terrain responds dynamically to different projectile types/sizes. Evaluate if the destruction algorithm preserves terrain stability (no floating islands unless intentional). Deduct 5 points if destruction is binary (all-or-nothing) rather than gradual, 3 points if the collision detection is imprecise, and 2 points if there are no visual effects for impact.

Check if water flows naturally downward, pools in depressions, and interacts properly with terrain boundaries. Evaluate if water affects player/enemy movement speed proportionally to depth.
