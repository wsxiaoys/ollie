      "title": "Is the core shooting game mechanics fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the player movement control, shooting mechanics, and hit detection through HTML5 Canvas/DOM elements. Score 0 if the core shooting interaction is not implemented, 5 if only basic shooting without collision detection exists, and 10 if it includes proper hit detection, target destruction, and score tracking.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the game includes appropriate physics for movement (acceleration/deceleration, boundaries), projectile trajectory physics (velocity, gravity if applicable), and collision response. Deduct 3 points if movement feels unnatural, 3 points if projectiles don't follow expected paths, and 4 points if collision responses are unrealistic. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the code includes a complete game lifecycle (start screen, gameplay, game over states) with proper state transitions. Verify if game parameters (health, score, ammunition) are tracked correctly. Deduct 4 points if there's no clear state management, 3 points if state transitions are buggy, and 3 points if game persistence is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess if the game includes varied enemy types or targets with different behaviors, and whether difficulty increases over time (speed changes, spawn rates, etc.). Deduct 4 points if enemies have no varied behaviors, 3 points if difficulty remains static throughout gameplay, and 3 points if enemy spawning is too predictable. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid input, browser resize, focus loss, resource loading failure, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Particle effects for impacts 4. Combo scoring system). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to shooting gameplay (e.g., a built-in chat system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that cause lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code is not properly organized into logical files/modules.

Deduct 5 points for input lag, 5 points for frame rate drops during normal gameplay, and 3 points for jarring transitions between screens/states. The full score is 10 points.",
