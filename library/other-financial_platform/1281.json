      "description": "Review whether the code properly integrates mobile-first frameworks (Vue3/React with mobile UI libraries like Vant/Ant Design Mobile), includes viewport meta configuration, touch event handling, and mobile-specific optimizations. Score 0 if basic mobile framework is missing, 5 if only basic responsive layout is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive mobile optimization including gesture handling, scroll optimization, and performance tuning is fully implemented.",

Must support incremental rendering for long responses and handle various LLM output formats (text, code blocks, lists, tables).

Must include authentic color schemes, typography, and component styling that reflects professional fintech design standards. Deduct 5 points if visual consistency is poor, 3 points if layout proportions are incorrect, and 5 points if key UI components are missing or poorly implemented. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to digital currency/LLM interaction (e.g., built-in games or irrelevant widgets) 3. Heavy animations that affect mobile performance (e.g., complex particle effects or excessive transitions).
