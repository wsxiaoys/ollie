Score 0 if the core system is missing, 5 if basic flashcard functionality is implemented but lacks systematic review, and 10 if a complete spaced repetition system (like Leitner or SuperMemo algorithm) is implemented with progress tracking.",

Deduct 5 points if there's no persistent storage implementation, 3 points if vocabulary categorization is missing, and 2 points if the data structure is inefficient for retrieval.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to vocabulary learning (e.g., a built-in general calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
