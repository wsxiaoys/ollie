      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the lottery probability algorithm, including weighted random selection, guarantee mechanism (pity system), and rarity distribution. Check if different vocabulary box types have distinct drop rates and if the probability calculation follows standard gacha mechanics. Score 0 if core lottery logic is missing, 5 if only basic random selection is implemented, and 10 if complete probability system with guarantee mechanism is included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the system allows dynamic content replacement for both weapons and vocabulary items. Check if the data structure supports easy modification of item pools, rarity levels, and metadata. Verify that the replacement mechanism maintains consistency in item properties and visual representations. Deduct 5 points if hardcoded item lists are used, and 3 points if item metadata is incomplete. Full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if the animation timing creates appropriate suspense and excitement. Verify that different rarity items have distinct visual treatments. Deduct 5 points if animations are missing or too basic, and 3 points if rarity differentiation is unclear. Full score is 10 points.",

Check if duplicate handling is properly managed and if players can view their collection history. Verify that item organization follows logical categorization. Deduct 5 points if inventory persistence is not implemented, and 3 points if duplicate item handling is missing. Give 10 points if fully implemented with statistics.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to lottery system (e.g., built-in chat system) 3. Excessive visual effects that impact performance (e.g., complex particle systems for every item).
