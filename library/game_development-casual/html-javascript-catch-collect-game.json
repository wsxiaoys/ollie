Make sure the code you generate is executable when possible.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a Catch and Collect game.\n**Task**: Implement a capture system where players can catch certain objects or creatures in the game and collect them.\n**Hint**: You can capture objects by throwing nets or using specific tools, then add them to the player's collection.\n[CHAT_SEP]Please optimize the above game response, and add comments to your code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "title": "Is the core capture system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code implements a complete capture system with mechanics for targeting, throwing/using capture tools, and determining success/failure rates. Check if capturing objects involves skill elements (like timing, aim, or resource management) rather than just simple clicks. Score 0 if no capture mechanics exist, 5 if basic clicking to capture is implemented, and 10 if the system includes varied capture tools with different properties and success calculations.",

Check for features like categorization, sorting options, viewing collection details, and persistent storage of collected items. Deduct 5 points if there's no storage persistence, and 3 points if the collection lacks organization features. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if there's only one type of collectible, 5 if there are multiple but with minimal differentiation, and 10 if there's a rich variety of collectibles with different behaviors, appearance, rarity levels, and capture requirements.",

Look for features like unlockable capture tools, achievements for collection milestones, increasing difficulty, or collection-based goals. Deduct 5 points if there's no sense of progression, and 3 points if progression is too linear or predictable. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to capture/collection gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down gameplay).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if comments are missing or unhelpful.
