Create a jumping game website featuring a red panda character (silly and cute, similar to Totoro style) with Studio Ghibli aesthetic. The background should include fantasy adventure elements. The gameplay should be similar to doodle jump.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the Doodle Jump style physics (gravity, jumping force, continuous upward scrolling). Check for smooth vertical movement, platform collision detection, and character control responsiveness. Score 0 if the core movement mechanics are missing, 5 if basic jumping is implemented but feels unnatural, and 10 if the jumping physics perfectly matches the Doodle Jump experience with proper acceleration curves.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the red panda character has the specified 'silly and cute' aesthetic similar to Totoro style. Character should be properly animated with at least idle, jumping, and falling animations. Check whether the character has expressive features and maintains the Studio Ghibli aesthetic (rounded shapes, soft colors, charming details). Deduct 3 points if the style doesn't match Totoro/Studio Ghibli aesthetic, 3 points if animations are stiff or missing, and 3 points if the character lacks expressiveness.",

Evaluate if parallax scrolling creates depth, if color palettes use the signature Ghibli soft pastels, and if environment elements maintain consistent artistic style. Deduct 5 points if the background lacks Ghibli aesthetic, 3 points if fantasy adventure elements are missing, and 3 points if background elements appear static without parallax effects.",

Evaluate platform variety (regular, moving, breakable, etc.), distribution algorithms (should avoid impossible jumps), and performance optimization (removing off-screen platforms). Score 0 if platform generation is missing, 5 if basic static platforms exist, 10 if there's a sophisticated system with multiple platform types and proper optimization.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the jumping game (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that cause lag).
