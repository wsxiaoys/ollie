      "title": "Is the core stickman character implementation complete?",
      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements the stickman character using HTML elements (canvas or SVG), with appropriate proportions and connections between body parts. Check if the stickman's anatomy is properly articulated (head, torso, arms, legs) with proper joint connections. Score 0 if no stickman is created, 5 if basic static stickman is implemented, and 10 if a fully articulated stickman with proper proportions is implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the code includes smooth animations for the stickman character (walking, jumping, etc.) using either CSS animations, JavaScript animation frameworks, or requestAnimationFrame. Check frame rate consistency (should maintain 60fps) and the naturalness of movements. Deduct 5 points if animations are jerky or choppy, 3 points if keyframes are poorly spaced, and 2 points if there are no transitions between animation states. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the mini-game has clear objectives, challenges, and interaction mechanisms. The game should have scoring systems, win/lose conditions, and at least one core gameplay loop. Deduct 5 points if there are no clear objectives, 5 points if the gameplay is too simplistic (just moving with no purpose), and 3 points if there's no scoring mechanism. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether user input (keyboard, touch, mouse) is properly captured and translated into stickman movements/actions. Check for responsiveness (input lag under 100ms), custom key bindings or touch areas, and proper event handling. Deduct 5 points if controls are sluggish, 3 points if multiple input methods aren't supported, and 5 points if there's no visual feedback for controls. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as window resizing, rapid input changes, browser compatibility issues) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Character customization options). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to the stickman game (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects or shader usage). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there are no comments explaining complex logic.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",
