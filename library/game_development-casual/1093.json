  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Write a 64 hexagrams divination application in pure HTML, with two buttons on the interface: \"Start Shaking\" and \"Stop\". When \"Start Shaking\" is pressed, the names of the 64 hexagrams will start scrolling. When the \"Stop\" button is pressed, it will randomly display one hexagram name and show its corresponding divination text.",

      "description": "Review whether all 64 hexagrams from the I Ching are correctly included with accurate names and corresponding divination texts. Check if hexagram data structure includes proper Chinese names, pinyin, and authentic interpretations. Score 0 if less than 50 hexagrams are included, 5 points if hexagrams are complete but texts are inaccurate or overly simplified, and 10 points if all 64 hexagrams with authentic divination content are fully implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the 'Start Shaking' function creates a smooth, continuous scrolling effect that cycles through hexagram names at an appropriate speed (recommended 50-100ms intervals). Check if the animation uses requestAnimationFrame or setInterval effectively, and whether the scrolling creates a realistic divination atmosphere. Deduct 5 points if scrolling is choppy or too fast/slow, 3 points if animation doesn't loop properly. Full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the stopping mechanism is instantaneous without delay and that the final result appears to be truly random across multiple tests.

Check if the result presentation is clear, readable, and maintains cultural authenticity. Deduct 5 points if only hexagram name is shown without interpretation, 3 points if formatting is poor or text is truncated.

Code with strong robustness should prevent double-clicking issues, handle edge cases gracefully, and maintain consistent behavior across different browsers. Give 10 points for excellent robustness, 5 points for average handling, and 0 points if no exception handling exists.",

Function modules unrelated to I Ching divination (e.g., unrelated games or calculators) 3. Excessive animations that distract from the spiritual nature of divination.
