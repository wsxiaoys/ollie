      "title": "Is the core decompression mechanic properly implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the code accurately implements the fundamental decompression mechanism (such as clicking, dragging, or interacting with stress-relieving objects). The core interaction should respond to user input with appropriate visual feedback and physics. Score 0 if no interaction is implemented, 5 if basic interactions exist but lack polish, and 10 if interactions feel natural and satisfying.",

      "title": "Are the game objects and physics systems correctly coded?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the game includes properly implemented physical objects with realistic behaviors (e.g., bouncing balls, squishable items, destructible objects). Verify that collision detection works correctly and physics parameters create a satisfying feel. Deduct 5 points if physics feels unnatural, 3 points if collisions are buggy, and 2 points if object interactions are limited.",

      "title": "Is the progression system or gameplay loop well-designed?",
      "description": "Assess whether the code includes some form of progression (like unlockable items, increasing challenges, or measurable stress reduction metrics). Check if there's a clear gameplay loop that encourages continued engagement. Give 0 points if there's no progression at all, 5 points if basic progression exists, and 10 if the system is thoughtfully designed with appropriate rewards.",

      "description": "Review whether the code includes appropriate visual effects (particle systems, animations) and sound effects that enhance the decompression experience. Judge whether they're synchronized with user actions and provide satisfying sensory feedback. Deduct 5 points if visual feedback is missing, 3 points if audio feedback is absent, and 2 points if the effects don't complement the interaction.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid clicking, unusual input combinations, window resizing, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Creative interaction methods beyond standard clicks/taps). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to decompression (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems causing lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation of concerns.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for interface elements that create rather than relieve stress. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each interaction without immediate feedback, 3 points for jerky animations, and 5 points for performance issues during intensive interactions. The full score is 10 points.",
