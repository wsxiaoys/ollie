      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements complete fishing mechanics including casting, waiting, and catching fish. Check if there's a timing or skill-based element that makes fishing engaging. Score 0 if no fishing mechanic exists, 5 if only basic clicking is implemented, and 10 if there's a fully developed fishing system with variable catch rates and player skill involvement.",

Deduct 5 points if there's no progression at all, 3 points if progression is minimal. The full score is 10 points for a comprehensive progression system that motivates continued play.",

Score 0 if there are no visual elements, 5 if only static images are used, and 10 if there are well-designed animations for casting, water effects, and fish movement that enhance the gameplay experience.",

      "description": "Check if the code properly manages game states such as starting/pausing the game, tracking inventory, saving progress or high scores, and handling win/lose conditions. Deduct 5 points if there's no state management, 3 points if it's rudimentary. Full score of 10 points requires a comprehensive state management system with persistence between sessions.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Sound effects that enhance immersion). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to fishing (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that slow down gameplay). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
