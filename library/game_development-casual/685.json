  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable. Please develop a marble elimination game where colored marbles are fired from the top of the screen. The player controls the firing angle and color to hit and eliminate marbles of the same color. When three or more marbles of the same color connect, they are eliminated, scoring points and adding time. If the marbles pile up to the bottom of the screen, display \"Game Over!\" Provide \"Start\" and \"Reset\" functions.",

      "title": "Is the core marble elimination gameplay correctly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the marble shooting mechanics, color matching logic, and elimination detection. Check if the player can control the firing angle and if the color selection mechanism is implemented. Score 0 if core gameplay is missing, 5 if basic shooting works but with flaws in color matching, and 10 if all elimination mechanics work flawlessly including proper physics for marble movement.",

      "description": "Evaluate the accuracy of collision detection between marbles and whether the code correctly identifies when three or more same-colored marbles connect. Check if the algorithm efficiently detects connections in all directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal). Deduct 5 points if the detection has edge cases where connections are missed, 3 points if there's noticeable lag during collision processing. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify if the scoring scales appropriately based on the number of marbles eliminated simultaneously. Assess whether the timer countdown is smoothly implemented and visually clear. Deduct 5 points if the scoring system is basic/static, 3 points if the timer doesn't integrate with gameplay events. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if state transitions are handled cleanly without bugs or glitches.

Function modules unrelated to the marble game (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).
