Deduct 5 points if dinosaurs appear only as generic icons without thematic integration, 3 points if the dinosaur theme feels disconnected from gameplay. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should handle these edge cases effectively, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the match-3 or dinosaur theme 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or appropriate design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no separation of concerns.
