  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to provide executable code whenever possible. Could you help me design a small cat character, similar to the scenario in the \"Moon Rabbit Adventure\" game, that comes online once every 15 minutes to collect bamboo? I need this programming work right now.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the cat character has a distinct visual style with proper proportions, colors, and details. Check if the design is implemented using appropriate HTML5 Canvas or SVG techniques with clean path definitions or sprite sheets. Award 10 points for a professional-looking character with smooth outlines and thoughtful design; 5 points for a basic but functional design; 0 points if the character is poorly defined or visually unappealing.",

      "description": "Examine the code that handles the periodic appearance of the cat character. Verify if it uses proper JavaScript timing functions (setTimeout, setInterval) or more modern approaches like requestAnimationFrame with timestamp tracking. Check for proper clearance of timers to prevent memory leaks. The timing should be accurate within 1-2 seconds. Deduct 5 points if the timing is inconsistent, 3 points if it doesn't handle browser tab inactivity correctly, and give 0 points if the timing mechanism is missing or fundamentally flawed.",

Check if there are smooth transitions between states (approaching, collecting, leaving) with appropriate easing functions. Verify that the collection logic tracks bamboo counts correctly and provides visual feedback. Award 10 points for polished animations with proper state management; 5 points for functional but basic implementation; 0 points if the collection process is broken or missing.",

Check if localStorage/sessionStorage is used appropriately to save bamboo counts, cat appearance times, and other relevant data. Verify that the state restoration works correctly when the page is reloaded.

Code with strong robustness should include error handling, fallback mechanisms, and graceful degradation.
