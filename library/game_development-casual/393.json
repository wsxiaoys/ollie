      "title": "Is the core claw machine gameplay mechanic fully implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the code implements the three main phases of claw machine gameplay: positioning, dropping, and grabbing. The claw should move horizontally in both X and Y axes, drop vertically when triggered, close to grab items, and retract. Verify that the claw movement has appropriate physics (acceleration/deceleration). Score 0 if core interaction logic is missing, 5 if only basic movement exists without proper physics, and 10 if all mechanics are properly implemented with realistic physics.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes all three required prize types with distinct visual appearances. Each prize type should have proper collision detection with the claw and realistic physics when being grabbed or dropped. The prizes should be randomly distributed in the machine at the start. Deduct 3 points if any prize type is missing, 3 points if the prize physics are unrealistic, and 2 points if there's no variety in each prize type (e.g., different colors or sizes).",

      "description": "Check if the claw machine cabinet is properly rendered with a 3D-like perspective or isometric view that allows players to clearly see the prizes and claw positions. The machine should have transparent walls and a visible prize collection chute. Deduct 5 points if the perspective makes gameplay difficult, 3 points if the machine lacks depth perception, and 3 points if the collection mechanism isn't visually represented.",

Check for visual and audio feedback during gameplay (button highlights, claw movement sounds, prize capture sounds). Deduct 3 points for unintuitive controls, 3 points for missing visual feedback, and 4 points for lack of audio feedback indicating success or failure.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Skill-based claw strength adjustment 3. Combo system for grabbing multiple items). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to the claw machine (e.g., a built-in unrelated mini-game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects causing lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if assets are not properly organized or optimized.
