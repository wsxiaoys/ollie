  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the code you generate is executable. I want to develop a small game with the following design: 1. A horizontal line from left to right in the screen, serving as the ground; 2. The main character appears on the left side of the screen, on the ground; 3. The main character's position remains fixed, while enemies continuously appear from the right side of the screen on the ground; 4. When the screen is clicked, the main character can jump up to avoid enemies; 5. If the main character collides with an enemy, the game is over. I plan to develop this small game with Cursor. Please help me organize a plan and generate a complete solution document for Cursor development. You can ask me questions after understanding the above content, one question at a time, until the plan is complete.",

All elements should be properly positioned and scaled relative to the canvas/viewport. Score 0 if any core element is missing, 5 if elements exist but with positioning issues, and 10 if all elements are properly implemented with appropriate scaling on different screen sizes.",

The jump should have natural acceleration and deceleration with proper timing (not too quick or too slow). Deduct 5 points if there's noticeable input lag (>100ms), 3 points if the jump physics feels unnatural, and 2 points if jump height is inconsistent or inappropriate for gameplay.

Check if the enemy generation logic includes variety (different speeds, sizes, or types) for gameplay interest. Deduct 5 points if enemies spawn at fixed intervals without progression difficulty, 3 points if movement is jerky/inconsistent, and 5 points if there's no variety in enemy types or behaviors.

It should be precise (not triggering on near misses), performance-optimized, and visually matched to the sprites (no invisible collisions). Deduct 5 points if hitboxes don't match visual elements, 5 points if collisions are inconsistently detected, and 3 points if there's noticeable performance impact from collision checks.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games within the main game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particles that cause lag).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation between game mechanics, rendering, and input handling.
