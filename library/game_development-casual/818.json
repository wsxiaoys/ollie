  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable. Create a whack-a-mole style game where the opening animation shows Nezha saying to a marmot \"Still eating? I'm coming for you!\" Then the game begins with Nezha using his Fire-tipped Spear to hit marmots that try to steal food from a bowl. Players earn points for each marmot they hit. Include different difficulty levels. The animation style should be simple and cute anime-style characters.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the whack-a-mole gameplay through HTML/JavaScript, including marmot spawn/hide timing control, hit detection system, and scoring mechanism. Check if marmots appear randomly from different holes with proper timing intervals. Score 0 if core game loop is missing, 5 if only basic spawn/hide is implemented, and 10 if complete hit detection, scoring, and game state management are included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether Nezha character responds correctly to player clicks/taps with Fire-tipped Spear striking animation. Check if the spear animation aligns with hit detection timing and provides visual feedback for successful/missed hits. Deduct 5 points if spear animation is not synchronized with hit events, 3 points if Nezha character lacks proper attack animations. Full score requires smooth character animation with proper weapon mechanics.",

I'm coming for you!' to a marmot character with proper dialogue display and character animations. Evaluate if the transition from opening sequence to gameplay is smooth. Deduct 5 points if dialogue is missing or poorly timed, 3 points if character animations during dialogue are static.

Check if difficulty progression is balanced and provides appropriate challenge scaling. Deduct 5 points if only superficial difficulty changes exist, 3 points if difficulty balance is poor. Full score requires at least 3 distinct difficulty levels with proper game parameter adjustments.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively manage edge cases like simultaneous hits, animation conflicts, and state management issues. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic robustness, and 0 points if no exception handling exists.",
