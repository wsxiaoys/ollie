  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Develop an Eight-Characters (BaZi) fortune telling software using index.vue in uni-app with BuilderX that can calculate birth eight characters, major life cycles, yearly fortune and other information. Please provide me with the complete code. I am a beginner, so the process should be detailed.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements accurate Chinese lunar calendar conversion, celestial stems and earthly branches calculation, and the Four Pillars formation (year, month, day, hour). Score 0 if core BaZi calculations are missing, 5 if basic calculations are implemented with minor inaccuracies, and 10 if the implementation includes all traditional calculation methods with leap month handling.",

Deduct 5 points if gender-specific calculations are missing, and 3 points if cycle transitions are incorrectly handled. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to BaZi fortune telling (e.g., irrelevant horoscopes) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance.
