  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the code you generate is executable. I want to develop a WeChat mini program with the following features: users can create coins to join families, wear family emblems, publish photos and text which can be commented on, and implement a real-time family activity ranking board. The activity level can be increased through online time, number of comments, published content, etc. Please refine and optimize these requirements, and provide the relevant development process and program code. In addition to the above, add a game module where players can earn points for rankings by playing games.",

Check if the system includes permissions hierarchy (admin/member), invitation mechanisms, and family statistics. Score 0 if the core family functions are missing, 5 if only basic family creation and joining is implemented, and 10 if the system includes complete family management with role-based permissions.",

Check for image compression, content filtering mechanisms, and proper database structures. Deduct 3 points if media upload lacks progress indicators, 3 points if there's no content moderation mechanism, and 4 points if comments lack pagination or proper notification systems.

Evaluate if real-time updates are implemented using cloud functions or WebSocket, and if the system includes anti-cheating mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if the ranking algorithm is simplistic or easily exploitable, and 5 points if there's no real-time update mechanism. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for multiple game options, difficulty levels, and anti-cheating measures.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to family/social system (e.g., unnecessary utility tools) 3. Heavy animations or effects that affect performance on limited mobile devices.
