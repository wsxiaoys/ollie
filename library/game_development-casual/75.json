      "title": "Is the core typing mechanism implemented correctly?",
      "description": "Examine if the code properly captures keyboard input, matches it with displayed text, and updates the game state accordingly. Check for event listeners that handle keypress/keydown events, input validation against the target text, and appropriate visual feedback for correct/incorrect typing. Award 10 points for complete implementation with accurate character matching, 5 points if only basic functionality works but has edge cases, and 0 if core typing detection is missing.",

      "description": "Verify if the game includes essential metrics like typing speed (WPM), accuracy percentage, and a time-based or completion-based scoring system. Check for features like countdown timers, progression levels, or difficulty settings. Award 10 points for a comprehensive system that tracks multiple metrics and provides meaningful feedback, 5 points for basic scoring only, and deduct points if calculations contain errors.",

      "description": "Assess how text content is generated for typing practice. Look for variety in content (random words, sentences, paragraphs), difficulty progression, and possibly themed content categories. Ideal implementation should avoid repetition and have sufficient content volume. Award 10 points for dynamic content generation with multiple difficulty levels, 5 points for static but sufficient content, and deduct points if content is too limited or contains errors.",

      "description": "Examine if the game visually indicates typing progress (highlighting current character, showing completed text differently), displays errors clearly, and provides real-time stats. Check for features like cursor position tracking and visual distinction between correct and incorrect inputs. Award 10 points for comprehensive feedback system with clear visual indicators, 5 points for basic feedback, and deduct points for confusing or missing visual cues.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid typing, special character inputs, browser focus issues, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Heat maps showing problematic keys 4. Adaptive difficulty based on user performance). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to typing practice (e.g., unrelated mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down typing response). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation between UI and game logic.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the overall design follows modern design principles: 1) Harmonious color matching (no more than 3 primary colors) 2) Proper layout spacing (element spacing follows the 8px multiple principle) 3) Professional font system (body font size â‰¥ 14px, line height over 1.5 times, monospace font for typing text). Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for poor text readability that hinders typing. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for input lag that affects typing experience, 3 points for jerky animations during gameplay, and 5 points for distracting visual effects that make text hard to read.
