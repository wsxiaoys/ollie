      "title": "Is the sailing game core mechanics fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements sailing physics through HTML5 Canvas/JavaScript, including wind direction effects on boat movement, sail angle adjustments, and realistic boat dynamics (acceleration, deceleration, turning). Check if character symbols effectively represent boat, wind indicators, and environmental elements. Score 0 if core sailing mechanics are missing, 5 if only basic movement is implemented, and 10 if realistic sailing physics with wind interaction are fully included.",

Check for wind visualization, compass/direction indicators, and collision detection with environmental elements. Deduct 5 points if environmental boundaries are not implemented, and 3 points if wind direction indicators are unclear or missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if there are multiple difficulty levels or progressive challenges. Deduct 5 points if no clear win/lose conditions exist, and 3 points if scoring mechanism is missing. Assess whether the game provides meaningful progression and replayability. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether character symbols are used creatively and intuitively to represent game elements (boat: ⛵ or ^, waves: ~, wind: →, islands: ●, etc.). Check if symbols are consistent, visually distinguishable, and scale appropriately. Review if there's a legend or help system explaining symbol meanings. Deduct 5 points if symbols are confusing or inconsistent, and 3 points if scaling issues affect readability. Give 10 points if symbols create a cohesive and intuitive visual system.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as out-of-bounds movement, invalid input, browser compatibility issues, canvas rendering errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like window resizing, keyboard/mouse input validation, and game state corruption. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic exception handling, and 0 points if no exceptions are handled.",

Multi-boat AI opponents 4. Sound effects using Web Audio API 5. Procedurally generated maps). Evaluate creativity in using character symbols for advanced visual effects or animations.

Function modules unrelated to sailing gameplay (e.g., built-in calculator) 3. Overly complex character symbol animations that affect performance or readability. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core sailing functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for proper Canvas usage, efficient rendering loops, and memory management. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or no design patterns are used; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no optimization for animation frames or Canvas performance.
