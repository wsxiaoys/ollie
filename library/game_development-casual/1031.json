      "description": "Check if the code accurately implements random dice generation using JavaScript Math.random() or similar function. The dice values should be properly generated within the range of 1-6 (or appropriate range for the specified dice). Score 0 if no random functionality exists, 5 if random generation is implemented but with potential bias or incorrect range, 10 if properly implemented with equal probability distribution.",

Check if the pip patterns correctly match standard dice patterns (e.g., 1 center pip for value 1, diagonal pips for value 3). Deduct 5 points if only textual representation is used, 3 points if visual dice faces exist but with incorrect patterns. The full score is 10 points.",

The interface should make it obvious how to interact with the program. Deduct 5 points if there's no clear roll button/mechanism, 3 points if the interaction is present but confusing.

      "description": "Check if the dice roll includes an appropriate animation effect (such as spinning, shaking, or transitioning between values) to simulate physical dice behavior. The animation should enhance the user experience and provide a sense of randomness.

Code with strong robustness should work consistently across different scenarios, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no error handling exists, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to dice rolling (e.g., unnecessary animations or features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particles or animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
