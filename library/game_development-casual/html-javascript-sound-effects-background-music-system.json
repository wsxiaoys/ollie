Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration purposes.\n\nPlease implement an environment sound effects and background music system using HTML and JavaScript.\n\n**Task**: Add environmental sound effects and background music to the game to enrich the atmosphere, and dynamically adjust sound effects according to different scenes.\n\n**Hint**: You can use sound effect triggers to control sound playback, and switch background music based on scene changes.\n\nPlease include some comments in your code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements robust audio resource loading with preloading strategy, error handling for failed audio loads, and proper memory management. Check if the implementation includes both HTML5 Audio API and Web Audio API fallback options. Score 0 if core audio playback is missing, 5 if only basic playback is implemented without error handling, and 10 if it includes comprehensive audio resource management with loading indicators and fallback mechanisms.",

      "description": "Check whether the code implements a variety of environmental sound effects with proper trigger mechanisms based on user actions or environmental conditions. Evaluate if effects use spatial audio positioning, have appropriate volume levels, and include randomization for natural variation. Deduct 3 points if spatial audio is missing, 3 points if sound variety is limited (less than 3 effect types), and 5 points if trigger mechanisms are simplistic or hardcoded.

Check if volume normalization is handled across different tracks, and if looping is properly implemented without audible gaps. Deduct 4 points if transitions are abrupt without crossfading, 3 points if music doesn't adapt to different scenes, and 5 points if looping implementation has gaps or glitches.

Check if the UI for these controls is accessible and intuitive. Score 0 if no audio controls exist, 5 if basic controls exist but lack persistence or separate volume controls, and 10 if comprehensive controls with preference saving are implemented.",

Code with strong robustness should detect browser capabilities, provide fallbacks, and gracefully handle initialization failures with user prompts. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic error checks, and 0 points if no exception handling exists.",
