      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a counter system that tracks button presses for each player, with clear progression toward the 10-press goal. Check if the winning condition (first to 10 presses) triggers the rod animation to hit the opponent's hand. Score 0 if the core interaction logic is not implemented, 5 if basic counting is implemented but without proper winning conditions, and 10 if the full game loop with proper win detection is implemented.",

Check for input validation, prevention of key-spamming exploits, and clear visual feedback when buttons are pressed. Deduct 5 points if inputs aren't clearly separated between players, and 3 points if there's no visual feedback on button presses. The full score is 10 points.",

Review the timing of the animation to ensure it properly represents the game state. Deduct 5 points if the animation is jerky or unrealistic, and 5 points if the hit detection doesn't visually align with the rod and hand positions. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the hand-hitting game (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down gameplay).
