      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements random dice generation, score calculation, and turn-based gameplay. Score 0 if the core logic is missing, 5 if only basic dice rolling is implemented without complete game rules, and 10 if the game includes comprehensive rules (scoring system, win conditions, etc.).",

      "description": "Check if the dice rolling includes proper visual feedback (animation, transitions, or at minimum state changes) that makes the randomness feel authentic. Deduct 5 points if there's no visual feedback during rolls, 3 points if the animation is jerky or unnatural, and 2 points if the dice representation is too simplistic (e.g., just numbers without dice faces).",

Code with strong robustness should prevent game-breaking behaviors, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Statistics tracking across games 4. Special dice or bonus mechanics). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to dice gaming (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particles or animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if variables/functions are poorly named; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high; deduct 5 points if there's no separation of concerns between presentation and logic.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for jarring or inconsistent animations, and 5 points for confusing player action indicators. The full score is 10 points.",
