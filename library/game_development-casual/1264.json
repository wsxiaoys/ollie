I'd like to create a whack-a-mole mini-game. I'm a complete beginner, so please explain the detailed steps. Generate comprehensive code with explanatory comments.

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the whack-a-mole game mechanics through JavaScript, including random mole appearance, hit detection, and scoring system. Check if moles appear at random positions and timing, disappear after being hit or after a timeout, and if points are correctly awarded for successful hits. Score 0 if the core game logic is missing, 5 if basic functionality works but with issues, and 10 if the game mechanics are fully implemented with proper randomization and hit detection.",

Check if the implementation includes game board layout, mole holes, mole animations, hammer cursor/animation, and score display. Deduct 5 points if the UI doesn't follow WeChat Mini Program standards, and 3 points if essential visual elements are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if there's a clear progression system (increasing difficulty over time or levels) and if the game speed/challenge adapts to player performance. Deduct 5 points if there's no difficulty adjustment, 3 points if progression is too simple. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the implementation includes timer management, score tracking, high score recording, and proper game reset functionality.

Code with strong robustness should prevent cheating methods and handle edge cases effectively, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the whack-a-mole game (e.g., unnecessary mini-games within) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).
