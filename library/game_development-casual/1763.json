      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements vocabulary display, user input validation, scoring mechanism, and progress tracking through HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Check if it includes word-image matching, spelling exercises, and pronunciation features suitable for third-grade level. Score 0 if core learning interaction is not implemented, 5 if only basic word display is implemented, and 10 if complete vocabulary learning cycle with feedback is included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game includes appropriate difficulty progression, reward systems (stars/badges), and encouraging feedback mechanisms suitable for 8-9 year olds. Check for implementation of hint systems, mistake tolerance, and positive reinforcement. Deduct 5 points if difficulty curve is too steep, and 3 points if reward feedback is insufficient. Full score requires engaging gamification elements that maintain child attention.",

      "description": "Check whether the system tracks individual word mastery levels, implements spaced repetition algorithms, and provides progress visualization suitable for children. Evaluate if it includes vocabulary categorization, difficulty adjustment based on performance, and learning analytics. Deduct 5 points if no progress persistence is implemented, and 3 points if vocabulary difficulty adaptation is missing.",

Check for implementation of session time limits, clear navigation, and error prevention mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if accessibility guidelines for children are not followed, and 3 points if safety considerations are missing.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid input, browser compatibility issues, audio loading failures, etc.) and provide child-friendly error messages or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle edge cases without breaking the learning experience, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Collaborative learning modes 4. Adaptive storytelling with vocabulary). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented that enhances learning outcomes (maximum 10 points).",

Features inappropriate for third-graders (complex interfaces, advanced concepts) 3. Distracting elements that interfere with learning focus (excessive animations, irrelevant games). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core learning functions are compromised by inappropriate content.",

Deduct 5 points if code structure is chaotic or lacks educational software best practices; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate exceeds 30%; deduct 5 points if the codebase is not easily extensible for additional vocabulary sets.
