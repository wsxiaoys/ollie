      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the ball movement system through HTML5 Canvas/JavaScript, and whether it includes proper collision detection between the ball and dots. Score 0 if the core interaction logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic movement is implemented without proper physics, and 10 if smooth movement with proper momentum and collision is fully implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the ball moves automatically with intelligent pathfinding towards dots, implements proper decision-making algorithms for selecting which dots to target, and handles movement smoothly without player intervention. Deduct 5 points if the automation is rudimentary (straight-line movement only), and 3 points if the decision-making isn't optimized. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if scoring is absent or simplistic, and 3 points if difficulty doesn't increase as the player progresses. Give 10 points if fully implemented with visual feedback.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core gameplay (e.g., unnecessary settings) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the game loop implementation is inefficient.
