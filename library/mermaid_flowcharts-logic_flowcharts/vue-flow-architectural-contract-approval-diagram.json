      "description": "Check whether the code correctly implements the architectural contract approval process using vue-flow, including proper node types (start, approval steps, decision points, end), directed edges with correct flow direction, and appropriate edge styles. Score 0 if vue-flow is not implemented at all, 5 if only basic nodes and edges are present without proper flow logic, and 10 if the complete architectural design approval process is accurately represented with appropriate node types and logical flow connections.",

Deduct 2 points for each missing critical stage. Check if conditional paths and decision points are correctly implemented (e.g., reject/revise/approve branches). The full score is 10 points.",

Test if custom interactions relevant to contract approval (like approval action buttons, status changes, document attachment) are functional.

Examine if state management is implemented correctly.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to architectural contract approval (e.g., built-in chat that's not for approval communication) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down diagram rendering).
