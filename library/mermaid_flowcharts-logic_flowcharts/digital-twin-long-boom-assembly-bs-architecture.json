  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate, professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable whenever possible. Based on the following content, please help me design a diagram.\n\nDevelop a digital twin system for controlling deviations in long boom assembly processes based on the Browser-Server (BS) architecture model, as shown in the figure. Adopt a front-end and back-end separation development model to improve system maintainability and development efficiency. The back-end algorithm model is developed using Python language, while the front-end builds an interactive user interface through the modern JavaScript framework React. The system uses MySQL database to process and store large amounts of data and interacts with the back-end through APIs. The Fetch API, an HTTP client library, is used to implement communication between the front-end and back-end.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a complete BS architecture with clear front-end/back-end separation. Check if React is properly integrated on the front-end and Python on the back-end, with appropriate API interfaces between them. The architecture should include data flow diagrams showing how information moves between components.0 points if basic architecture is missing, 5 points if only basic separation exists, 10 points if complete architecture with clear component responsibilities and data flows is implemented.",
