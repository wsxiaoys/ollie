      "description": "Review whether the code correctly initializes the Three.js environment (renderer, scene, camera, lighting). Check if the canvas is properly configured for responsive design, if WebGL detection is implemented, and if there's a proper animation loop. Score 0 if setup is missing, 5 if basic setup exists but lacks optimization, 10 if fully optimized with fallback options.",

Check if the code handles mouse/touch events correctly (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup), implements proper object selection via raycasting, and maintains object position relative to camera view during drag. Deduct 5 points if dragging works only on one plane, 3 points if there's noticeable lag during dragging. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the code implements collision detection when objects are being dragged. Evaluate whether it uses bounding box, bounding sphere, or more complex collision algorithms appropriate for the scenario. Deduct 5 points if collision is detected but objects can still intersect, 3 points if collision is limited to specific object types. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if there's a clear selection indication (highlighting, outline) and if proper transformation gizmos are implemented. Score 0 if only single object movement is supported, 5 if multi-selection exists but with limitations, 10 if full group transformation capabilities are implemented.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Excessive visual effects that impact performance. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core movement functionality is interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance optimizations are implemented.

Deduct 3 points for poor lighting that makes objects difficult to see, 5 points for unclear visual hierarchy, and 5 points for lack of visual feedback during interaction.
