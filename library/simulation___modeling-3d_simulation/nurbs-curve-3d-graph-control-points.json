Help me create a program for a NURBS curve in a three-dimensional graph, which should display both the NURBS curve and its control points, then visualize this program.",

      "title": "Is the NURBS curve implementation mathematically correct?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the NURBS curve mathematical formulation, including basis functions, knot vectors, weights, and proper parameterization. Score 0 if the core NURBS formula is incorrect, 5 if basic B-spline functionality is implemented but weights aren't properly handled, and 10 if the implementation fully supports rational curves with mathematically sound calculations.",

      "description": "Check whether the visualization correctly renders the NURBS curve in 3D space with appropriate resolution (enough points to make the curve appear smooth). The curve should be continuously rendered without visual artifacts or gaps. Deduct 5 points for discontinuities in the curve, 3 points for insufficient sampling causing a 'jagged' appearance, and 2 points if curve extremities are improperly handled.

      "description": "Evaluate whether control points are clearly visible as distinct markers in the 3D space, with appropriate size and contrast against the curve. Check for interactive features such as hovering effects, selection capability, or dragging functionality to modify curve shape. Deduct 5 points if control points lack visual distinction, 5 points if no interaction with control points is possible, and 2 points if the control polygon (lines connecting control points) is missing.

Deduct 5 points if changes to control points don't update the curve in real-time, and 3 points if the visual connection between points and curve isn't intuitive. Give 10 points if the relationship is immediately clear and educational.",

Test boundary conditions like minimum number of control points for the specified degree. Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle these cases with appropriate error messages or constraints. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic validation only, and 0 points if the code fails under common edge cases.",

Visualization features unrelated to NURBS demonstration (e.g., unrelated 3D models) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance without educational benefit. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state is overused; deduct 5 points if the NURBS evaluation algorithm is inefficient (e.g., naive implementation instead of optimized recursive approaches); deduct 5 points if mathematical operations aren't numerically stable.
