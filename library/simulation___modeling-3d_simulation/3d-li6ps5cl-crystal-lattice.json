      "description": "Evaluate whether the code correctly represents the Li₆PS₅Cl crystal structure with proper atom positions, bond lengths, and lattice parameters according to crystallographic data. Check if the code uses the correct space group (F-43m) and includes all atomic positions for Li, P, S, and Cl atoms. Score 0 if the structure is completely inaccurate, 5 if basic structure is present but with significant errors, and 10 if the structure matches published crystallographic data with high accuracy.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code implements the substitutional doping of Br at Cl sites with appropriate visualization (distinct colors, sizes, or labels). The implementation should show the distribution of dopants either randomly or at specific sites based on energetic considerations. Deduct 5 points if only one halogen element is shown, 3 points if the doping is visually indistinguishable, and 2 points if the doping ratio is unrealistic. The full score is 10 points.",

The visualization should distinguish between different pathway types (intra-cage vs. inter-cage transitions) and indicate energy barriers. Deduct 5 points if pathways are static only, 5 points if energy barriers are not indicated, and 3 points if the coordination environment changes during migration are not shown.

The rendering should include proper lighting, camera controls, perspective, material properties, and anti-aliasing. Deduct 3 points for missing camera controls, 3 points for improper lighting that obscures structural details, 2 points for lack of material differentiation between elements, and 2 points for missing anti-aliasing.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to crystal structure visualization (e.g., unnecessary UI elements) 3. Effects that affect performance without adding scientific value (e.g., excessive particles or animations).
