Help me implement a step-by-step animation simulation of fire evacuation based on Cesium, including steps such as fire outbreak, alarm activation, personnel evacuation, fire truck arrival, firefighting, etc.",

      "description": "Check if the code includes proper Cesium initialization, with correct API keys, terrain provider configuration, and high-resolution imagery for realistic building representation. The viewer should have proper camera controls and navigation settings. Score 0 if Cesium is not initialized, 5 if basic initialization is present but lacks optimization, and 10 if fully configured with performance optimizations.",

      "description": "Review the fire simulation algorithm for realism including fire spread patterns, smoke propagation physics, and environmental factors (wind, building materials). Visual effects should include particle systems for flames/smoke with proper opacity, color gradients, and lighting. Deduct 5 points if fire spread is unrealistic, 3 points if smoke physics is missing, and 3 points if visual effects lack dynamic elements. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for agent-based modeling with realistic human behaviors (panic, group dynamics, leader-following). Deduct 5 points if basic path-finding is missing, 3 points if crowd density is not considered, and 5 points if evacuation doesn't account for fire spread. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for realistic time delays between steps and proper coordination of resources. Deduct 3 points if alarms don't trigger properly, 5 points if emergency vehicles don't follow realistic routes, and 5 points if firefighting logic doesn't consider fire intensity and type.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to fire evacuation (e.g., unnecessary weather effects) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that slow rendering).
