  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be careful to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. I now have radar point cloud data and several corresponding photos. Could you write code that would render and reconstruct this into a three-dimensional scene?",

      "title": "Is the point cloud data processing pipeline fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements data parsing, filtering, and preprocessing of radar point cloud data. Score 0 if there's no implementation for handling raw point cloud data, 5 if basic parsing is implemented but lacks noise filtering and outlier removal, and 10 if the code includes comprehensive point cloud processing with normalization, downsampling, and statistical outlier removal techniques.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements camera calibration and fusion of 2D images with 3D point cloud data. Check if transformation matrices are properly calculated and applied. Deduct 5 points if camera intrinsic parameters are hardcoded without calibration options, 3 points if the registration process lacks error metrics. The registration should handle multiple viewpoints correctly and provide visual validation of the alignment quality.",

Score 0 if no reconstruction logic exists, 5 if a basic reconstruction is implemented but lacks texture mapping or surface refinement, and 10 if the implementation includes advanced features like mesh generation, texture mapping, and surface optimization algorithms.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to 3D reconstruction (e.g., unrelated image processing tools) 3. Computationally expensive visualizations that don't contribute to understanding the scene.
