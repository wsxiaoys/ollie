      "description": "Review whether the code implements an accurate 3D model of a robotic arm with proper joints, segments, and movement constraints. The model should include proper hierarchical structure (base, joints, links, end-effector) with appropriate degrees of freedom for each joint. Score 0 if the model is not implemented, 5 if only basic structure exists, and 10 if a complete, anatomically correct robotic arm with configurable parameters is implemented.",

Check for proper socket programming, protocol handling (TCP/UDP), error handling, reconnection logic, and data buffer management. Verify if the code handles connection timeouts, packet loss, and data integrity validation. Deduct 5 points if no error handling exists, 3 points if reconnection logic is missing.

Look for coordinate system transformations (e.g., from robot coordinate system to world coordinate system), unit conversions, and proper handling of different data formats (JSON, binary, custom protocols).

Check if the code properly initializes the 3D environment, handles camera positioning, implements lighting, and renders the robotic arm in real-time.

Function modules unrelated to robotic arm visualization (e.g., unnecessary image processing) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects).
