  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you provide is executable and can be demonstrated. I am a photography practical training instructor, and when conducting portrait photography sessions in a studio, lighting setup is a challenging aspect. I would like to design a virtual photography studio lighting scenario. Please help me design the code for this.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately creates a 3D/2D virtual studio environment with proper spatial dimensions, camera positioning, and subject placement. Check if the studio can be viewed from multiple angles. Score 0 if no proper environment is created, 5 if a basic environment exists but lacks detail, and 10 if the studio environment is complete with proper scale and perspectives.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements various lighting types (key light, fill light, rim light, background light, etc.) with adjustable parameters (intensity, color temperature, softness, angle). Check if light modifiers (softboxes, umbrellas, reflectors, snoots) are implemented. Deduct 5 points if only basic lighting is available, 3 points if light modifiers are missing.

      "description": "Check whether the lighting effects follow physical principles, including proper shadow casting, light falloff with distance, color blending, and reflections. Verify if the code simulates the inverse-square law for light intensity. Deduct 5 points if shadows are unrealistic, 3 points if light falloff is incorrect. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if it includes drag-and-drop functionality, sliders for intensity/temperature controls, and visual indicators of light direction. Deduct 3 points for each essential control missing, and 5 points if the interface is confusing or unintuitive. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Before/after comparison views 4. Simulated portrait with different skin tones). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Fancy effects that affect performance and distract from the educational purpose. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a distracting color scheme that makes light evaluation difficult, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout.
