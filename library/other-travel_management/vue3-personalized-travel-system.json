  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you provide is executable whenever possible. Nowadays, people often use holidays to travel to various places. A personalized travel system can help people manage their travel activities, offering features such as travel destination recommendations, travel route planning, tourist attraction queries, and travel diary sharing.\n\nBefore traveling: First select travel destinations based on popularity, reviews, and personal interests;\nDuring travel: Within attractions (including schools), plan optimal visiting routes based on sightseeing goals, provide attraction information and location queries while touring;\nAfter traveling: Generate travel diaries based on photos taken and travel experiences.\n\nAccording to these requirements, please build a Vue3-based website framework that implements the above features. Include the App.vue and main.js files, and list all additional dependencies that need to be installed.",
