      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the core conversion functionality, including file selection, image processing, and PDF generation. Score 0 if the conversion logic is absent, 5 if only partial conversion is implemented (e.g., only file selection works), and 10 if the complete PNG to PDF pipeline is functional.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code provides a proper file input system with support for PNG file filtering, multiple file selection, and validation. Deduct 3 points if the input doesn't filter for PNG files, 3 points if it lacks multiple file selection when appropriate, and 2 points if there's no file validation. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Is the PDF generation process correctly implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the PDF generation uses proper libraries (like jsPDF, PDF.js, or appropriate APIs), maintains image quality during conversion, and handles page formatting. Deduct 5 points if image quality is significantly degraded, 3 points if page formatting options are missing, and 5 points if the PDF cannot be downloaded. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the implementation addresses memory concerns when dealing with large PNG files, includes progress indication for lengthy operations, and implements strategies like chunking or streaming for large files. Deduct 5 points if there's no memory management strategy, 3 points if it lacks progress indication, and 5 points if it fails with larger images. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as unsupported file formats, conversion failures, browser compatibility issues) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

PDF customization options like page size, orientation, margins 3. Batch processing with progress indicators). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple PDF generation methods coexisting) 2. Function modules unrelated to PNG to PDF conversion (e.g., unrelated image filters) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if modern web standards are ignored.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",
