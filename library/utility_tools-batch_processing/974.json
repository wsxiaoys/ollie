Prioritize using Meitu's pre-signed URL solution, and only switch to third-party storage if stability issues arise.\n\nI would like to implement something similar. Please provide detailed code for a program that opens with an interface containing adjustable beauty parameters. After setting the parameters and clicking \"Start Retouching,\" the software will monitor a specified folder, automatically process any incoming images using the preset retouching parameters, and then export them to a designated output folder.",

Check if parameter ranges are appropriate with reasonable defaults. Score 0 if there's no UI implementation, 5 if only basic controls exist without proper organization, and 10 if a comprehensive, well-designed parameter adjustment panel is provided with visual previews of effects.",
