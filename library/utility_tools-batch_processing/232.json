      "description": "Review whether the code uses React hooks correctly (useState, useEffect, useRef) and follows React 16.8+ best practices. Check that functional components are properly structured with appropriate dependency arrays in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks. Score 0 if hooks are misused, 5 if basic implementation is correct but with minor issues, and 10 if the implementation follows all React best practices including proper cleanup functions.",

Check for correct stream handling, proper MIME types for video, and browser compatibility considerations.

Code with strong robustness should handle these edge cases effectively, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to video downloading (e.g., unrelated media processing) 3. Heavy dependencies that could be avoided with simpler implementations.
