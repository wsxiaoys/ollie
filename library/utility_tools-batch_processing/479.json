  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Develop a speech-to-text tool that allows users to upload audio files (mp3, wav formats) or record speech in real-time using a microphone. The tool should convert speech content into text and display the recognition results on the interface in real-time. Users should be able to pause, continue input, and edit the recognized text. The interface should also provide language selection (supporting at least English and Chinese), speech rate adjustment functionality, and text export capabilities (supporting txt and doc formats). You can use the browser's built-in speech recognition API or integrate third-party APIs.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the implementation properly handles both file uploading (.mp3, .wav formats) and real-time microphone recording. Check for proper file validation, format detection, and error handling for unsupported formats. Verify that the microphone access requests appropriate browser permissions and provides fallback options. Score 0 if neither input method works, 5 if only one method is implemented or both have significant issues, and 10 if both methods are fully functional with proper error handling.",

Check for proper initialization, event handling, error recovery, and continuous recognition capability. Verify language detection accuracy and appropriate handling of recognition confidence levels. Deduct 5 points if recognition doesn't work reliably, 3 points if language support is limited to fewer than two languages, and 2 points if there's no visible feedback during recognition.

Check if the interim results are displayed differently from final results, if there's a clear visual indication of the recognition status, and if text editing preserves formatting and cursor position. Deduct 5 points if real-time display is missing, 3 points if pause/resume functionality doesn't work properly, and 3 points if text editing capabilities are limited. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to speech-to-text (e.g., unnecessary media players) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that delay transcription display).
