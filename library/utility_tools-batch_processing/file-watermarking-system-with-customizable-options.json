Create a file watermarking system where users can upload documents, images, and other files, and set watermark text. The watermark position and transparency level should be adjustable according to user preferences.",

Check if it supports multiple file formats as required (documents, images, etc.), and handles upload progress indication. Score 0 if file upload is not implemented, 5 if only basic upload is supported without validation, and 10 if comprehensive upload with all security measures and support for multiple formats is included.",

Check if it allows custom text input with proper sanitization and supports various text formatting options (font, size, color).

Check if the positioning works correctly across different file types and maintains proper alignment on resize/rotation.

Function modules unrelated to file watermarking (e.g., unnecessary file editing tools) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during watermark application).
