      "description": "Review whether the code properly configures Tauri with React integration, including correct tauri.conf.json setup, proper Rust backend commands, and IPC (Inter-Process Communication) between frontend and backend. Check if the build process generates functional native executables for target platforms. Score 0 if Tauri core functionality is missing, 5 if basic setup exists but lacks proper IPC, and 10 if fully functional with secure command invocations and proper error handling.",

Check for correct package.json dependencies, proper component imports, and theme configuration. Verify that Tailwind classes are purged correctly and Shadcn components render with consistent styling. Deduct 3 points if component library integration is incomplete, 5 points if styling conflicts exist, and 2 points if build optimization is missing. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the auto-update mechanism includes proper version checking, secure download verification (signature validation), and graceful update installation. Evaluate if the updater handles network failures, provides user notifications, and supports rollback mechanisms. Verify that update endpoints are configured correctly and SSL/TLS is enforced. Deduct 5 points if signature verification is missing, 3 points if no fallback mechanism exists, and 5 points if update UI feedback is inadequate. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper TypeScript configuration, ESLint/Prettier setup, and development/production environment separation. Verify that all necessary configuration files (vite.config.js, tailwind.config.js, components.json) are properly set up. Deduct 3 points for missing TypeScript support, 4 points for inadequate build configuration, and 3 points for missing development tooling. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should include proper error boundaries, async error handling, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points if fully implemented, 5 points if basic error handling exists, and 0 points if no exception handling is present.",

Native notifications and system integration 3. Custom window controls and themes 4. Local database integration 5. Cross-platform native file handling).

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple state management solutions coexisting) 2. Unnecessary dependencies that bloat the bundle size 3. Over-engineered components that don't utilize Tauri's native capabilities effectively. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if redundant code significantly impacts application performance or bundle size.",

Check for proper component composition, custom hooks usage, and build optimization. Deduct 5 points if TypeScript types are poorly defined; deduct 5 points if component architecture is monolithic; deduct 5 points if build process lacks platform-specific optimizations.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the UI follows modern design principles using Shadcn components effectively: 1) Consistent design system with proper Tailwind utility usage 2) Proper spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale 3) Accessible color contrast ratios and focus states 4) Responsive design that works across different screen sizes. Deduct 3 points for inconsistent component usage, 5 points for poor color accessibility, and 5 points for non-responsive layouts. Full score is 10 points.",
