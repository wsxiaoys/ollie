      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements core packet capture functionality using appropriate libraries (like libpcap/npcap/node-pcap) with Vue 2.0. Check if it captures packet headers and payloads, performs protocol analysis, and allows filtering of packets. Score 0 if core capture logic is absent, 5 if basic capture works but lacks protocol analysis, and 10 if it fully implements capture with comprehensive protocol decoding (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, etc.).",

Check for proper permissions handling, native module bindings, and system tray integration.

Function modules unrelated to packet capture (e.g., built-in media player) 3. Fancy effects that affect capture performance (e.g., excessive animations during packet capture).
