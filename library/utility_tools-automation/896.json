      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements Chinese character matching, including full character matching, partial character matching, and radical-based search. Check if it supports traditional and simplified Chinese conversion, and handles polyphone characters correctly. Score 0 if basic Chinese recognition is missing, 5 if only simple character matching is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive Chinese character processing including stroke order and radical recognition is fully supported.",

Check if it supports both full Pinyin and abbreviated Pinyin input modes. Deduct 5 points if tone-insensitive matching is missing, and 3 points if fuzzy matching for common Pinyin confusions is not handled. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate the accuracy of language detection and switching algorithms, and whether cross-language matching is supported (e.g., English keywords matching Chinese results). Deduct 5 points if language switching has noticeable delays, and 3 points if mixed input causes search conflicts. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if caching strategies are implemented for common queries. Deduct 5 points if response time exceeds 200ms for typical queries, and 5 points if no input optimization techniques are used.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like empty inputs, extremely long queries, and special characters, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to search autocomplete (e.g., built-in translation services) 3. Fancy effects that affect search performance (e.g., heavy animations during typing). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core search functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
