      "description": "Review whether the code implements the basic components of a window system: window creation, positioning, resizing, maximizing, minimizing, closing, and z-index management. Score 0 if window creation and manipulation are not implemented, 5 if only basic operations are available, and 10 if all standard window behaviors (including snapping, restoring state) are included.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of window state tracking and persistence. Check for a centralized state management system that handles window positions, sizes, visibility, focus state, and stacking order. Look for proper event handling and state transitions. Deduct 3 points if window states are not properly persisted, 3 points if focus management is incorrect, and 4 points if state transitions are buggy or inconsistent.",

      "description": "Check if the framework allows dynamic content loading within windows and implements inter-window communication. Test if windows can exchange messages, share data, or access common services. Award full points if both iframe support and a messaging API are implemented with proper type safety. Deduct 5 points if windows are isolated with no communication mechanism, and 3 points if the communication is poorly typed or unreliable.",

      "description": "Review the TypeScript implementation for proper typing, interfaces/types for window configurations, proper use of generics, and type safety across the framework. Evaluate if the code leverages TypeScript features like discriminated unions, mapped types, or conditional types where appropriate. Deduct 5 points for any use of 'any' type, 3 points for insufficient interfaces/types, and 2 points for not using TypeScript features that would improve the code.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid window configurations, DOM manipulation errors, event race conditions, etc.) and provide friendly error handling or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should prevent window states from becoming corrupted and handle edge cases like rapid window operations or browser limitations. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic error handling, and 0 points if exceptions are not managed.",

Animated transitions between window states 4. Window theming system). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Unnecessary abstractions that complicate the codebase 3. Performance-heavy features that aren't essential to window management (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core window functions are negatively impacted by redundant code.",

Check for proper dependency management, code organization, and documentation. Deduct 5 points if global state is poorly managed; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no build configuration or it's inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for inconsistent window styling, 5 points for poor accessibility in window controls, and 5 points for awkward or unnatural window behaviors. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for jittery window movement, 3 points for slow or delayed responses to user input, and 5 points for any operation that freezes the UI for more than 100ms.
