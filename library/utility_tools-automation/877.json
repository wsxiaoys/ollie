      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the core packet capture functionality using appropriate libraries (like pcap, npcap, or libpcap bindings). Check if it can capture different protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.), filter packets by protocol/IP/port, and display packet details. Score 0 if core capture functionality is missing, 5 if basic capturing works but with limited protocol support, and 10 if comprehensive protocol analysis is implemented.",

Check for proper use of Vue's reactivity system, component lifecycle management, and appropriate use of Vuex/Pinia for state management. Examine whether the build process correctly bundles the application for Electron. Deduct 5 points if Vue-Electron integration has security issues, and 3 points if the build process is incomplete.

Verify if packet details can be exported in standard formats (PCAP, CSV, JSON). Deduct 5 points if visualization is basic or missing, 3 points if analysis tools are limited.

Check for proper error handling when permissions are denied, and verify appropriate use of native OS APIs through Electron.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to packet capture (e.g., a built-in media player) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down packet processing).
