  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Note that you should ensure the code you generate is executable and can be demonstrated. I work in e-commerce, specifically on the Pinduoduo platform. I want to write Python code that meets the following requirements: When run, it opens an interface that includes various automated work functions for the platform, such as automatically posting links, adding comments, and other operations. You can add any additional automation features you think would be useful. The code should be able to automatically recognize and perform operations. This might be challenging, but I believe you are definitely capable of accomplishing this.",

Check if element recognition, click simulation, text input, and form submission are properly handled. Score 0 if core automation logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic operations are implemented, and 10 if comprehensive automation workflows are fully functional.",

Check if progress indicators, log displays, and configuration panels are implemented. Deduct 5 points if the interface lacks operation feedback, and 3 points if function grouping is unclear.
