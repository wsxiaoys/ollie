Try to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\n======== Role ========\nYou are an experienced code expert. I am providing you with a software development requirement description and ask you to generate project code based on these requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code with simple and understandable comments, without outputting anything else.\n\n======== Output Rules ========\n1. You should always generate complete, runnable code for the project, making sure the project is fully executable\n2. Ensure that all code files you output are complete, without omitting any code\n3. Before final output, carefully review and check all code to evaluate its executability. If the code cannot execute or contains errors, regenerate it\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or require user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide mock data\n\n======== Project Requirements ========\nDevelop a webpage screenshot tool where users can input a URL and the tool automatically captures either a full-page screenshot or a specified area. The tool should support different screenshot sizes, and users should be able to download the captured images.",

Check if it includes resizable selection rectangles, precise coordinate tracking, and handles edge cases (like selections outside the viewport).

Function modules unrelated to screenshot capture (e.g., unnecessary social sharing) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
