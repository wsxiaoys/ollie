      "description": "Review whether the JSX script properly uses Photoshop's ExtendScript API, includes correct app.activeDocument references, and implements proper layer manipulation methods. Check if the script handles document validation, layer creation, and selection operations according to Photoshop 2025 specifications. Score 0 if basic Photoshop objects are not accessed, 5 if only simple operations work, and 10 if all core Photoshop APIs are properly integrated with error handling.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the script implements intelligent subject detection using Photoshop's built-in AI features (like 'Select Subject' or 'Remove Background'), includes edge refinement algorithms, and handles complex backgrounds. Check if the script uses proper selection methods like colorRange(), contract(), expand(), and feather() for precise cutouts. Deduct 5 points if edge detection is poor, 3 points if transparency handling is incomplete. Full score requires advanced selection refinement and multi-layer support.",

      "description": "Check whether the script provides true one-click functionality with minimal user intervention, includes batch processing for multiple images, and implements proper file handling (open, save, export). Evaluate if the script supports different input formats, automatic output naming conventions, and progress tracking. Deduct 5 points if manual intervention is required for each image, 3 points if batch processing fails on different file types. Full score requires seamless automation with robust file management.",

Check if the script remembers user preferences, includes undo functionality, and handles different color modes. Deduct 5 points if only basic PNG export is supported, 3 points if no user customization options exist. Full score requires complete preference management and format flexibility.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as locked layers, no active document, unsupported file formats, memory limitations, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should include try-catch blocks, proper error logging, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points if fully robust, 5 points if basic error handling exists, and 0 points if no exception handling is implemented.",

Smart background replacement suggestions 3. Automatic edge color correction 4. Batch watermark removal 5. AI-powered subject recognition training).

Unrelated image editing features (e.g., built-in filters or artistic effects) 3. Performance-heavy operations that don't improve cutout quality (e.g., unnecessary high-resolution previews).

Check for consistent naming conventions, adequate commenting, and reusable function structures. Deduct 5 points if global variable pollution is found or no modular pattern is used; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate exceeds 30%; deduct 5 points if functions are not properly documented or organized.

Deduct 3 points for each UI element that doesn't match Adobe standards, 5 points for poor visual hierarchy, and 5 points for confusing layout. Full score for native-looking, intuitive interface.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without user feedback, 3 points if processing hangs on large files without indication, and 5 points if memory usage is not optimized.
