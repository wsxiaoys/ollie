  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable for display purposes. Please create a Vue desktop application with browser management, plugin management, and settings menu. When clicking on browser management, it should display a paginated view with 10 items per page, showing workid and operation columns. The workid is an auto-incrementing ID starting from 1. Operations include start and stop buttons. Clicking start will launch Chrome.exe from a specified path with startup parameters:\n\n```javascript\nconst args = [\n    `--lang=zh-CN`,\n    `--timezone=${timezone || 'Asia/Hong_Kong'}`,\n    `--fps=${workId}`,\n    // `--window-icon=${iconPath}`,\n];\nconst allExtensions = [...(pluginPaths || [])];\nif (allExtensions.length > 0) {\n    args.push('--load-extension=' + allExtensions.join(','));\n    args.push('--disable-extensions-except=' + allExtensions.join(','));\n}\n```\n(This is what I wrote in JavaScript)",
