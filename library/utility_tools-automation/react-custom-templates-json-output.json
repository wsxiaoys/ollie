      "description": "Review whether the code establishes a clean component hierarchy with proper separation of concerns. Check for functional components using hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, etc.) instead of class components where appropriate. Assess if props are properly typed and documented. Score 0 if component structure is missing or severely flawed, 5 if basic components exist but with structural issues, and 10 if components follow React best practices with clear hierarchies and proper state management.",

Check for template component inheritance, slot mechanisms, or higher-order components that facilitate customization. Verify if the system includes template selection UI, preview capabilities, and the ability to modify template properties. Deduct 5 points if templates cannot be saved or reused, and 3 points if customization options are too limited. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the JSON output is properly formatted, includes necessary metadata, and can be parsed back into the application. Deduct 5 points if JSON validation is missing, and 3 points if the output format is inconsistent. Verify that complex data types are correctly serialized. The full score is 10 points.",

For simpler applications, local state should be sufficient; more complex ones should utilize global state management. Check for proper state normalization, immutability practices, and performance optimizations like memoization. Deduct 5 points if global state is overused for simple scenarios, and 3 points if state updates cause unnecessary re-renders. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should include proper error handling, input validation, and fallback UI components. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling strategies, 5 points if basic error handling exists but with gaps, and 0 points if exceptions are not handled.",
