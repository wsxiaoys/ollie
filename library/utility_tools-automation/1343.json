Score 0 if image handling is missing, 5 if basic loading works but lacks preprocessing, and 10 if it includes comprehensive image manipulation with proper error handling.",

Assess algorithm selection appropriateness for image search. Deduct 5 points if only basic pixel comparison is used, 3 points if advanced features are implemented but inefficiently.
