      "title": "Is the core printing functionality properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements essential printing functions: queue management, document processing pipeline, and printer communication protocols (such as IPP, CUPS, or direct driver integration). Score 0 if core printing logic is missing, 5 if basic printing is implemented without proper error handling, and 10 if the system includes comprehensive printing capabilities with status monitoring.",

      "description": "Check if the code implements a complete workflow from file submission to final printing, including file validation, preprocessing (format conversion if needed), print job scheduling, and post-processing notifications. Deduct 3 points if file validation is inadequate, 3 points if job prioritization is missing, and 4 points if there's no completion notification system. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the interface provides clear step-by-step guidance for users, supports multiple file upload methods, offers preview functionality, and includes payment processing if required. Deduct 3 points for confusing navigation, 3 points for limited file format support, and 4 points if the preview functionality is missing or inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points if error detection is limited, 3 points if notifications are unclear, and 4 points if recovery procedures are inadequate or missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle these scenarios with appropriate logging and recovery mechanisms, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exception handling exists, give 0 points.",

AI-based document optimization for print quality 3. Smart resource estimation before printing 4. Print job analytics dashboard).

Function modules unrelated to printing (e.g., unnecessary multimedia features) 3. Fancy effects that affect system performance (e.g., excessive animations in the interface). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if configuration management is poor with hardcoded values.
