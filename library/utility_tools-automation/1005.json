  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable. Disregard sections 4.4 and 4.5, and write out the software page display based on the following content:\n\n1) Video Detection Demonstration\n1. Click the open video icon to choose a video for detection, and the detection results will be displayed automatically. Clicking this button again will close the video.\n2. After opening the video, click \"Draw Line Segment\" and use the left mouse button to click two points on the displayed interface to draw a line segment for counting objects crossing the line.\n3. After completing the two points, click the \"Complete Drawing\" button to enable bi-directional counting and statistics of objects crossing the line in the video.\nNote: The \"Detection Duration\" displayed on the interface indicates the length of video time that has been detected [related to detection speed], not the actual elapsed time.\n\n(2) Camera Detection Demonstration\n1. Click the open camera icon to activate the camera for real-time detection. Clicking this button again will close the camera.\n2. After opening the camera, click \"Draw Line Segment\" and use the left mouse button to click two points on the displayed interface to draw a line segment for counting objects crossing the line.\n3. After completing the two points, click the \"Complete Drawing\" button to enable bi-directional counting and statistics of objects crossing the line in the video.\nNote: The \"Detection Duration\" displayed on the interface indicates the length of video time that has been detected [related to detection speed], not the actual elapsed time.",

Check if the video playback controls work properly and if the detection results are displayed in real-time. Score 0 if the video detection is not implemented, 5 if basic video loading works but detection has issues, and 10 if video detection functions flawlessly with proper error handling.",

Verify that the line remains visible after drawing and maintains its position during video playback. Deduct 5 points if the drawing mechanism is buggy, and 3 points if the visual feedback is unclear.
