      "description": "Review whether the code accurately sets up a Vue3 project with webpack, including proper configuration files (webpack.config.js), development and production modes, and essential loaders. Score 0 if the basic webpack configuration is missing, 5 if only basic configuration is implemented, and 10 if it includes optimized configurations for both development and production environments.",

The webpack configuration should include vue-loader with proper options. Deduct 5 points if SFC handling is incorrectly configured, and 3 points if Composition API features aren't supported.
