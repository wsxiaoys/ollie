Context: Food delivery robot project architecture: Frontend using uniapp vue3 js, API: Django, database: Django's built-in SQLite, MQTT service, ROS1. Requirements: Phone remote control sends MQTT messages, MQTT to JS, JS sends ROSJS to the robot's ROS1. Functionality needed: A mini-program compatible with both tablets and phones featuring smooth joystick controls for the robot vehicle.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a touchscreen joystick with HTML5/JavaScript, including touch event handling, movement range limitations, auto-centering, and haptic feedback. Score 0 if the core interaction is missing, 5 if basic movement is implemented but lacks responsive design, and 10 if the joystick works flawlessly across different screen sizes with proper touch and drag events.",

Verify that MQTT messages are properly formatted for robot control commands (velocity, direction, etc.). Deduct 5 points if there's no reconnection handling, 3 points if there's no connection status indication, and 3 points if message encoding/serialization is inefficient. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper error handling when ROS connection fails. Deduct 5 points if the implementation lacks connection state management, 3 points if it doesn't handle message type conversions properly, and 3 points if it doesn't include fallback mechanisms.

Check if the API includes proper validation, rate limiting, and error responses. Deduct 5 points if there's no authentication, 3 points if database models are poorly designed, and 3 points if the API lacks comprehensive documentation. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to robot control (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that impact responsiveness).

Examine uniapp component organization, Vue3 composition API usage, and code splitting strategies. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
