  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable and presentable when possible. Functional goal: Implement a mobile H5 application based on Fabric.js JSON data for template replacement. Users only need to upload images, text, prices, and other content, and use Fabric.js to generate images for user download. The application should include canvas controls such as layer adjustment, font color, etc.\n\nTechnology stack: Vue3 + wot-design-uni component library.\nSpecial requirements: Mobile adaptation, embedded in a mini program.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the Fabric.js template system with proper loading/parsing of JSON templates and handling of object replacements (images, text, prices). Score 0 if the core template replacement is not implemented, 5 if basic replacement works but has limitations, and 10 if the system handles all replacement types with proper validation and error handling.",

Deduct 2 points for each missing essential control (layer management, text editing, image manipulation). The implementation should use Fabric.js APIs correctly and maintain object states properly.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
