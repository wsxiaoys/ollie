  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable whenever possible. Implement a system that, after receiving all system functional requirements submitted by users, automatically calls AI to generate code, module by module, and then compiles them into a complete, runnable system code package. Keep it simple and easy to implement. I'm providing you with a simplified approach: first, implement only the ability to generate a simple management system, then use templates to standardize user input, simplifying the understanding of the input.",
