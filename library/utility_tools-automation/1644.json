  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to provide executable code whenever possible. I'm asking this question because I want to transmit users' real-time voice recordings to an SDK that will automatically convert speech to text. For example, a user could open an English video and simultaneously open my application, so while watching English videos, they can get real-time text conversion. Then, I'll call a text translation API to convert the text into Chinese. Please give me detailed instructions on how to create this project using Electron and implement a real-time voice recording demo.",

      "description": "Check whether the code correctly implements access to the microphone using Electron's native APIs or Web APIs (getUserMedia), and whether it properly handles permission requests and denials. Evaluate whether the recording process includes proper audio sampling rate (minimum 16kHz for speech recognition), bit depth (minimum 16-bit), and format configuration. Score 0 if recording functionality is missing, 5 if basic recording is implemented but with configuration issues, and 10 if properly implemented with customizable audio parameters and resource cleanup.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code establishes proper streaming connections to a speech recognition SDK (like Google Speech-to-Text, Amazon Transcribe, or Mozilla DeepSpeech). Check if the audio data is properly chunked and streamed in real-time rather than processed after complete recording. Ensure the implementation handles rate limiting, reconnection, and authentication with the SDK. Score 0 if no streaming implementation exists, 5 if basic implementation but without proper error handling or optimization, and 10 if fully implemented with buffering strategies and connection management.",

      "description": "Review whether the transcribed text is displayed in real-time with appropriate UI updates. Check if interim results are handled differently from final results, and if the text display includes timestamps or speaker identification if available. Verify if the implementation addresses common STT challenges like handling speech disfluencies and punctuation. Deduct 5 points if there's significant display lag (>500ms), and 3 points if the text formatting is poor or unreadable. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate the integration with a translation API (like Google Translate, DeepL, or Microsoft Translator). Check if the code handles API rate limits, caching of frequent translations, and batching of text segments for efficiency. Assess whether the translation happens in near real-time and if the implementation includes fallback mechanisms when API calls fail. Deduct 5 points if translations have significant delays (>1s), and 3 points if no error handling exists for API failures. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Multi-language support with automatic language detection 3. Exportable transcription history with timestamps 4. Voice activity detection to reduce API costs).

Function modules unrelated to voice recording and translation (e.g., unnecessary media playback features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., complex visualizations that consume CPU). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
