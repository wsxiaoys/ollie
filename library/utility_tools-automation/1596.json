      "description": "Evaluate whether the response thoroughly explains different AI approaches for webpage generation (e.g., GPT models, GAN-based solutions, template-based AI systems, automated layout engines). Score 0 if only a single approach is mentioned, 5 if multiple approaches are covered but lack technical depth, and 10 if the explanation includes multiple well-explained methodologies with their respective strengths and limitations.",

The solution should include either: 1) integration with AI APIs (like OpenAI), 2) a local ML model implementation, or 3) a hybrid approach. Test if the code executes without errors and produces valid HTML output. Deduct 5 points if the code requires significant modifications to run, deduct all 10 points if the code is fundamentally flawed or non-executable.",

      "description": "Assess if the implementation includes parsing and understanding user requirements (e.g., converting natural language descriptions to webpage specifications). The code should extract key elements like layout preferences, color schemes, and content structure from user inputs. Deduct 5 points if the solution lacks requirement parsing mechanisms, deduct 3 points if it fails to handle ambiguous user inputs. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the implementation allows for specification of style guides or brand requirements. Deduct 5 points if refinement is manual only, deduct 3 points if the customization options are too limited.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to webpage generation (e.g., unnecessary analytics tools) 3. Resource-intensive features that affect performance (e.g., excessive API calls or computations).
