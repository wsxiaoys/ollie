  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration. I need your help to write an HTML application that implements the following functions:\n\nRemind to clock in 5 minutes before work starts on each working day (excluding public holidays). Remind to clock out and sign in for overtime at 18:01. Remind to sign out from overtime at 20:31.\n\nThe screen must remain locked until the clock-in/out is completed. Each time someone clocks in or out, they will receive an encouraging message to provide emotional value.",

Check if the application correctly excludes weekends and public holidays from the reminder schedule. Deduct 5 points if any of the reminder times are incorrectly implemented, and 5 points if the holiday exclusion logic is missing or flawed. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the lock cannot be easily bypassed and persists until the required action is taken.

Function modules unrelated to attendance tracking (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the interface).
