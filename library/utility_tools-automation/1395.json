      "description": "Evaluate whether the response provides a thorough overview of available AI coding assistants that integrate with Visual Studio 2019. The analysis should cover both Microsoft's first-party tools and third-party extensions. Deduct 3 points if major tools are missing, 5 points if integration methods aren't explained. Full implementation scores 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the response compares the technical capabilities of different tools (language support, code generation capabilities, context understanding, etc.). A complete comparison should include feature matrices, supported programming languages, and limitations. Deduct 5 points if only surface-level comparison is provided without technical depth.

      "description": "Evaluate whether any sample code provided demonstrates error handling, input validation, and follows best practices for the respective languages. Code with strong robustness should handle edge cases and include appropriate comments explaining complex logic. Give 10 points for excellent robustness, 5 points for average implementation, and 0 points if no error handling is included.",

Excessive theoretical explanations without practical application. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core information is obscured by redundant content.",
