  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the generated code is executable. I need your help to write an HTML music player page. 1. It should be able to play 10 music tracks plus one interference audio. 2. After playing each music track, it will automatically play the interference audio once and then continue to the next music track, cycling through this pattern. 3. It also needs a pause button. When I press the pause button, the music won't stop immediately, but will pause after the current track finishes playing.",
