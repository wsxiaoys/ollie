Design a blog recommendation system that displays a list of related recommended blogs at the bottom of the blog detail page. The blog recommendations should be based on article tags and content relevance.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements content-based filtering or collaborative filtering algorithms for blog recommendations. Check if the solution handles tag matching, content similarity analysis (TF-IDF, cosine similarity, etc.), and appropriate weighting mechanisms. Score 0 if no recommendation logic exists, 5 if only basic tag matching is implemented, and 10 if a sophisticated hybrid recommendation system is fully implemented.",

Check for efficient indexing of tags and content for quick similarity calculations. Deduct 5 points if the data model doesn't support efficient queries for recommendations, and 3 points if relationship mappings between blogs are not properly defined. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should handle edge cases like new blogs with no historical data. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if no exceptions are handled.",

Feature modules unrelated to blog recommendations (e.g., unnecessary social media integrations) 3. Performance-heavy features that don't enhance recommendation quality (e.g., excessive animations).
