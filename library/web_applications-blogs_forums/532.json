Check if it includes user account integration, persistent storage of subscription relationships, and proper UI elements for subscription management. Score 0 if core subscription logic is missing, 5 if basic follow functionality exists but lacks comprehensive management features, and 10 if the implementation includes all necessary components (subscription toggle, followed authors list, subscription management panel).",

Check if it includes necessary elements: article title, author name, timestamp, close button, and a link to the article. The notification should be non-intrusive yet noticeable. Deduct 3 points if the alert lacks responsive design, 3 points if it doesn't handle multiple notifications gracefully, and 4 points if accessibility features (like keyboard navigation or screen reader support) are missing.

Verify that the system respects these time preferences and doesn't send notifications outside the specified periods. Test edge cases like timezone handling and daylight saving time transitions. Score 0 if time filtering is absent, 5 if basic time filters exist but have limitations, and 10 if comprehensive time preference management is implemented with proper validation and timezone support.",

Check for implementation of notification queuing, delivery confirmation, and handling of missed notifications when users return after being offline.
