      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements Vue's component-based architecture. Check for appropriate component organization (parent-child relationships), proper props passing, and emit event handling. Evaluate the use of Vue lifecycle hooks. Score 0 if components are not used at all, 5 if basic components exist but are poorly organized, and 10 if components follow best practices with clear responsibilities and reusability.",

Verify if v-model is correctly used for two-way binding. Assess if the field includes visual cues for validation states. Deduct 5 points if URL validation is missing, 3 points if there's no error feedback, and 2 points if the input doesn't have proper UI states (focus, error, etc.). The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the displayed content includes essential news elements (title, summary, source, timestamp, etc.). Deduct 5 points if news items lack visual hierarchy, 3 points if there's no loading state or empty state handling, and 2 points if the layout breaks with different content lengths.

Check for debouncing on user input, case-insensitive search, and ability to search across multiple fields (title, content, etc.). Verify if search results update reactively. Deduct 5 points if search is not optimized and causes performance issues, 3 points if the search lacks features like highlighting matches, and 2 points if there's no indication of search results count.

Check for try-catch blocks around API calls and proper error state management. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to news briefings (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations on news items). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for proper naming conventions, comments, and TypeScript usage if applicable. Deduct 5 points if global state is mismanaged; deduct 5 points if the code has high duplication; deduct 5 points if there's no separation of concerns (mixing API calls with UI logic).

Check for proper responsive design using Vue's responsive classes or media queries.

Check for properly implemented animations that enhance rather than hinder the user experience.
