      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a responsive three-column layout using proper HTML/CSS techniques (flexbox, grid, or appropriate responsive techniques). Check for proper containment, alignment, and spacing between columns. Score 0 if columns are not implemented correctly, 5 if the layout is functional but not responsive, and 10 if the columns are fully responsive with appropriate breakpoints for different screen sizes.",

Check if content is properly separated from presentation. Deduct 5 points if data is hard-coded without structure, 3 points if there's no clear separation between data and presentation. Full marks require modular data handling that would facilitate easy content updates.",

Test for event handling, smooth transitions, and proper feedback on user interaction. Deduct 5 points for non-functional links, 3 points for missing hover states, and 5 points for inaccessible interactive elements. Full score requires complete interaction implementation with appropriate visual feedback.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to content display (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
