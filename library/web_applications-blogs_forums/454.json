Check if essential features like reactive state management, computed properties, and lifecycle hooks are implemented correctly. Score 0 if Vue 3 features are poorly implemented, 5 if basic implementation exists but with architectural issues, and 10 if properly implemented with TypeScript interfaces and type checking.",

Check for SASS customization of Element Plus themes to maintain brand consistency. Deduct 5 points if Element Plus is barely used, 3 points if components are used but not customized, and 2 points if accessibility features are ignored. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if there's a consistent design system with variables for colors, spacing, and typography in SASS files.

Frontend should handle API errors gracefully, and backend should implement proper validation and error responses. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to blogging (e.g., a complex game inside a blog) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations on blog list).
