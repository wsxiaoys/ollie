      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements HTML5 Audio API or Web Audio API for music playback, including play/pause, volume control, progress tracking, and playlist management. Check if it supports multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, OGG) and includes proper audio loading states. Score 0 if basic playback is not functional, 5 if only simple play/pause works, and 10 if all core audio features including seamless track transitions are implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the time-based scheduling mechanism uses accurate timing APIs (setInterval/setTimeout or Web Workers for precision). Check if it includes timezone handling, schedule conflict resolution, and persistent storage of scheduled playlists. Deduct 5 points if scheduling accuracy exceeds ±30 seconds, 3 points if timezone issues aren't handled, and 5 points if schedules don't persist after browser refresh. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the system implements intelligent playlist creation based on time context (morning, afternoon, evening, night) with appropriate music categorization logic. Evaluate if it includes music metadata analysis, mood-based selection, or learning from user preferences. Deduct 5 points if playlists are randomly generated without context awareness, 3 points if music categorization is overly simplistic. Full score requires sophisticated algorithmic playlist generation.",

Check for drag-and-drop support, bulk operations, and music file validation. Deduct 5 points if file management is basic, 3 points if search functionality is missing, and 5 points if no bulk operations are supported.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Voice control integration 4. Sleep timer with fade-out 5. Social sharing of playlists). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to music playing (e.g., built-in games or social media feeds) 3. Fancy effects that affect audio performance (e.g., heavy visual effects during playback). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core music functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
