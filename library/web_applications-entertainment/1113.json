      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a proper card-based layout for displaying music items with appropriate spacing, shadows, and responsive design. Check if the cards have proper hover effects, click interactions, and consistent sizing. Score 0 if there's no card implementation at all, 5 if basic card structure exists but lacks visual refinement, and 10 if a complete, polished card system is implemented.",

Check if the audio is managed properly with Vue refs and if the UI state reflects playback status accurately. Deduct 3 points if progress tracking is missing, 3 points if volume control is absent, and 4 points if play/pause functionality is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess how the application handles local file access, including file selection, metadata extraction (artist, album, duration), and storage of user preferences. Check for file type validation and error handling when dealing with unsupported formats. Award 10 points for complete implementation with proper error handling, 5 points if basic file selection works but lacks metadata extraction, 0 points if local file access is not implemented.",

Check if state management is properly implemented using Vue's reactivity system.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as corrupted audio files, browser storage limitations, user operation errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to music playback (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that impact playback). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if prop drilling is used instead of provide/inject or proper state management; deduct 3 points if TypeScript types are missing or incorrect; deduct 2 points if component cohesion is poor.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",
