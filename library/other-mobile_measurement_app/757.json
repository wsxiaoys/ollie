      "description": "Check whether the code properly integrates Flutter's camera API to capture high-quality images, with proper permissions handling, preview display, and image storage. The implementation should include error handling for camera unavailability scenarios. Score 0 if camera functionality is missing, 5 if basic functionality exists but with issues, and 10 if fully implemented with proper error handling and optimization for different device capabilities.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the app uses an appropriate algorithm for calculating real-world distances from image pixels. Check if it implements either a reference object method (comparing to known-size objects) or camera parameters-based calculation (using focal length and sensor data). The algorithm should account for perspective distortion. Deduct 5 points if calculations are mathematically unsound, 3 points if the method requires complex manual calibration, and 2 points if accuracy significantly deteriorates at different distances. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess the calibration mechanism that establishes the pixel-to-real-world conversion ratio. An effective system should guide users through a simple calibration process (e.g., placing a reference object of known dimensions), store calibration data, and allow recalibration. Deduct 3 points for each missing component: guided calibration UI, persistent calibration storage, or recalibration option. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate the precision controls (e.g., zooming capability for pixel-level selection, draggable points with visual feedback, undo/redo functionality). The interface should handle edge cases like selecting points near the image boundaries. Deduct 3 points for each missing precision feature and 5 points if points cannot be adjusted after initial placement. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to distance measurement (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations slowing down the measurement process). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
