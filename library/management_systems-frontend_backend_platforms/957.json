      "description": "Evaluate whether the code provides a comprehensive approach to integrate DeepSeek for React project generation, including proper API initialization, authentication handling, and response parsing. Check if the implementation includes error handling for API limitations and rate limits. Score 0 if there's no clear DeepSeek integration, 5 for basic implementation without error handling, and 10 for robust integration with complete error recovery mechanisms.",

Check if it includes methods for parsing various specification formats (Figma links, JSON, text descriptions) and translating them into detailed AI instructions. Deduct 3 points if it only handles one type of specification format, 5 points if the translation lacks detail preservation, and 8 points if there's no validation mechanism to ensure specification accuracy.

Examine if the implementation produces modern React practices (hooks, functional components), follows component composition patterns, and maintains proper prop typing. Check for state management integration options. Deduct 3 points if generated components use outdated patterns, 5 points if component architecture is flat without composition, and 5 points if there's no TypeScript/PropTypes support.

Check if the implementation includes steps for project scaffolding, component generation, styling integration, routing setup, and build configuration. The pipeline should include intermediate validation steps and allow for iterative refinement.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Unnecessary abstraction layers between the application and DeepSeek 3. Inefficient code generation patterns that produce bloated React components. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
