      "description": "Review whether the code properly initializes shadcn/ui with correct Tailwind CSS configuration, components.json setup, and proper CLI installation. Check if the theme provider is correctly implemented with dark/light mode support. Score 0 if shadcn is not properly configured, 5 if basic setup exists but missing theme configuration, and 10 if complete integration with proper theming system is implemented.",

Check if components are customized using the built-in variant system and className overrides. Deduct 3 points for each improperly imported component, 5 points if no component customization is shown. Full score requires diverse component usage with proper styling.",

Evaluate if React best practices are followed including proper component composition, custom hooks usage, and state management. Deduct 5 points if components are not properly separated, 3 points if no custom hooks are implemented, 5 points if the folder structure is chaotic.

Check for proper interface definitions, generic types usage, and type safety. Score 0 if plain JavaScript is used, 5 if basic TypeScript without proper typing, 10 if comprehensive TypeScript integration with proper type definitions and modern React patterns.",

Code with strong robustness should include error boundaries, loading states, and proper error handling, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no error handling exists, give 0 points.",

Complex data tables with sorting/filtering 3. Interactive dashboard components 4. Custom theme switching mechanisms).

Unnecessary third-party libraries when shadcn components exist 3. Over-engineered solutions for simple UI tasks. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if redundant code interferes with the clean architecture demonstration.",

Check for proper component reusability, consistent naming conventions, and clean code principles.
