Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration purposes.\n\n======== ROLE ========\nYou are an experienced code expert. I will provide you with a software development requirement description, and I need you to generate project code based on these requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code with clear and easy-to-understand comments. Don't output anything else.\n\n======== OUTPUT RULES ========\n1. Always generate complete, runnable project code and ensure the project is fully executable\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete without omitting any code\n3. Carefully review and check all code before final output, evaluating its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, regenerate it\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or need to use user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide simulated data\n\n======== PROJECT REQUIREMENTS ========\nPlease write code to implement a contract management system where users can upload contract files, categorize and tag them with keywords, and support online contract signing. The system should provide contract template management, allowing users to quickly generate standard contracts. Administrators should be able to review contract signing status and generate contract signing statistical reports.",
