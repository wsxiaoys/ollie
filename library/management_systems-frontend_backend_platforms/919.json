Clicking \"Submit Feedback\" will open a new page for writing feedback; change \"Feedback Notification\" to \"Historical Feedback\"; delete all content below \"Try to create a feedback box below\" and replace it with \"Resolved Feedback List\" for display, clicking on any specific feedback item will take you to the detailed feedback page; please provide me with all the code.",

Check if clicking 'Submit Feedback' correctly opens a new page with a functional feedback form including input fields, validation logic, and submission processing. Score 0 if no form implementation exists, 5 if only basic form structure is present without validation, and 10 if complete form with validation, error handling, and successful submission flow is implemented.",

Check if the DOM manipulation is clean and doesn't cause layout issues. Deduct 5 points if text replacement is incomplete, 3 points if DOM manipulation causes visual glitches, and 5 points if the replacement doesn't maintain proper styling consistency.

Check if state management maintains data consistency across page transitions and if browser navigation (back/forward) works correctly. Deduct 5 points if routing is implemented but buggy, 5 points if state is lost during navigation, and 3 points if browser navigation doesn't work properly.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like empty submissions, malformed data, and failed page transitions.
