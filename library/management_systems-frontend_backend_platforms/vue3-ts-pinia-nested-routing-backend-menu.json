      "description": "Assess if the Vue 3 application is properly initialized with TypeScript support. Check for proper tsconfig.json configuration, correct component typing (defineComponent, defineProps, defineEmits with proper types), and appropriate type declarations. Score 0 if TypeScript is not properly integrated, 5 if basic TypeScript is used but with any/unknown types, and 10 if strict type checking is enabled with comprehensive custom types and interfaces.",

Verify if the store correctly handles menu data persistence, loading states, and error handling. Deduct 5 points if the store doesn't use TypeScript interfaces, 3 points if actions don't handle async operations properly, and 2 points if getters lack memoization where appropriate.

Check for proper route transformation logic, lazy-loading implementation, route guards for authentication, and correct handling of route parameters. Deduct 5 points if the dynamic route generation doesn't handle nested children properly, 3 points if route meta information is missing, and 2 points if navigation guards aren't implemented.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to menu and routing (e.g., built-in analytics that should be separated) 3. Over-engineered solutions that impact performance (e.g., excessive recursive menu processing).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or composition API isn't used effectively; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no code splitting for routes.
