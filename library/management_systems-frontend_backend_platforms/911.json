      "description": "Check whether the code properly implements the entire industrial defect detection pipeline: image acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification/detection algorithms, and result visualization. Score 0 if the core detection workflow is missing, 5 points if basic detection is implemented but lacks optimization, and 10 points if a comprehensive pipeline with multiple detection techniques is provided.",

Look for proper implementation of <script setup>, ref/reactive usage, and computed properties. Deduct 3 points for each anti-pattern (like not using shallowRef for large objects), 5 points if Suspense is not properly handled for async components, and 3 points if Vue 3 performance features (like v-memo) are not utilized where appropriate.

Check if WebRTC is used for camera stream handling and if processing pipeline is optimized. Deduct 5 points if processing causes UI freezes, 3 points if image processing is not parallelized, and 3 points if frame rate drops below 15 FPS for standard operations. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for visualization of defect patterns over time, severity classification, and integration with industrial standards. Deduct 3 points if reports lack visual data representation, 5 points if historical analysis is missing, and 3 points if export formats are limited (should support at least PDF, CSV, and JSON).

Code should handle edge cases like varying lighting conditions and unexpected object presentations.

Real-time defect classification confidence scores 4. Automated camera calibration). Add 2.5 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Unnecessary UI elements that distract from the main industrial workflow 3. Heavy animations or effects that could impact system performance in an industrial setting. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core detection functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 3 points if global state is overused, 3 points if test coverage for critical detection algorithms is below 80%, 2 points if the build process isn't optimized for industrial settings, and 2 points if there's no performance profiling implemented.
