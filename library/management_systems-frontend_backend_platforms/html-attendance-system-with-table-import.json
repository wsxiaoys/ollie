      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the fundamental attendance tracking features, including user registration, check-in/check-out functionality, and attendance records storage. Score 0 if the core functions are missing, 5 if basic attendance tracking is implemented but lacks advanced features, and 10 if all necessary attendance tracking features are comprehensively included.",

Verify that the import process includes data validation, error handling, and proper display of imported data. Deduct 5 points if the import function is basic without validation, 3 points if only one format is supported, and 2 points if the UI for import is unintuitive. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if data persistence handles browser refreshes and includes backup mechanisms. Deduct 5 points for poor data structure design and 3 points if data retrieval is inefficient.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to attendance tracking (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations for basic operations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code lacks comments or documentation.
