  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable whenever possible. Please write code to implement a building drawing management system where architects can upload CAD drawings and BIM models. The system should support online drawing preview, version comparison, annotation marking functions, provide project classification and drawing numbering management, support drawing approval workflow, and be able to record drawing modification history and reasons for changes.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a secure upload mechanism for CAD drawings and BIM models, including proper file type validation, size checking, and storage management. Check if the system handles various CAD/BIM formats (DWG, DXF, RVT, IFC) and optimizes storage through compression or cloud storage integration. Score 0 if the upload functionality is missing, 5 if basic upload exists without format validation, and 10 if a complete, secure, and optimized upload system is implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the system includes robust rendering engines to display CAD drawings and BIM models directly in the browser without requiring special software. Check if the preview supports essential functions like zooming, panning, layer toggling, and 3D model rotation for BIM. The preview should work across major browsers and maintain drawing fidelity. Deduct 3 points if the preview is limited to certain file types, 4 points if 3D model interactivity is missing, and 3 points if the rendering quality is poor or slow. The full score is 10 points.",

The annotation system should support text notes, measurement tools, redline markups, and the ability to assign annotations to specific team members. Deduct 3 points if visual diff is missing, 3 points if annotation types are limited, and 4 points if annotation sharing/assignment capabilities are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

The workflow should support multi-stage approvals with role-based permissions, electronic signatures, and automatic notifications. Deduct 3 points for lacking custom classification hierarchies, 3 points for manual numbering, and 4 points if the approval workflow doesn't support parallel or conditional paths.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to drawing management (e.g., a built-in general chat system not tied to drawings) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when switching between drawings). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for proper handling of large files through streaming or chunked processing. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
