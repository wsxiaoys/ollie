      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements essential checkout features including product scanning/input, price calculation, discount application, and receipt generation. Check if the system can handle different product types (weighted vs. unit items). Score 0 if core functionality is missing, 5 if basic checkout works but has limitations, 10 if fully functional with proper error handling.",

Check for CRUD operations for managing products. Deduct 5 points if there's no stock tracking, 3 points if product data structure is inadequate. Full score requires persistent storage implementation.",

Verify if promotions can be time-limited and combined according to rules. Deduct 5 points if only basic discounts are implemented, 3 points if discount conflict resolution is missing. Full score requires flexible promotion rule configuration.",

Check if common supermarket operations like price overrides and quantity adjustments are easily accessible.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to checkout (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if error handling is inconsistent.
