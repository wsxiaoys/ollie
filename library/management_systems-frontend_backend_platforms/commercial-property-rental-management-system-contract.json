Check if property listing details include essential information (location, size, price, availability).

Check that URLs are structured logically, breadcrumbs are provided, and the current page is highlighted in the navigation.

Code with strong robustness should include form validation, handle edge cases, and provide meaningful error messages, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to property management (e.g., a built-in game for tenants) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations on dashboard).
