  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Help me create an equipment inventory/ledger similar to this, including fields such as: serial number, station internal number, product number, equipment model name, asset value, main technical specifications, manufacturer, production date, purchase date, whether it's a measuring instrument, accuracy level, calibration status, equipment condition status, service life, dedicated personnel, and department. At the top, summarize the items that are in normal use, idle, under repair, scrapped, and the total count. Please implement this step by step, with detailed instructions as if for a beginner.",

      "description": "Check if the schema includes all required fields (serial number, station internal number, product number, equipment model name, asset value, technical specifications, manufacturer, production date, purchase date, measuring instrument flag, accuracy level, calibration status, equipment condition, service life, dedicated personnel, department). Ensure proper data types are used (e.g., dates for dates, numeric for values, enums for statuses). Verify that appropriate constraints are implemented (primary keys, foreign keys, not-null constraints for critical fields). Score 0 if missing more than 5 fields, 5 if missing 1-4 fields, 10 if complete and properly typed.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a summary section that accurately counts and displays equipment by status categories (normal use, idle, under repair, scrapped) and shows the total count. Check if the summary automatically updates when inventory changes. Verify if visualizations (charts/graphs) are used to represent the data. Score 0 if the summary is missing, 5 if it's static or incomplete, 10 if it's dynamic, complete, and visually informative.",

Verify if the code allows adding new equipment with all required fields, viewing equipment details (individual and list views), updating equipment information, and removing/archiving equipment records. Check for validation of input data before processing. Score 0 if missing multiple CRUD operations, 5 if basic operations exist but lack validation or have limited functionality, 10 if all operations are fully implemented with proper validation.",

Check if it breaks down complex concepts, explains technical terms, includes code comments, and provides guidance on potential pitfalls. Verify if it covers setup instructions, dependencies installation, and deployment steps. Score 0 if instructions are highly technical or missing, 5 if they cover basics but lack details, 10 if they are truly beginner-friendly and comprehensive.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to equipment inventory (e.g., unnecessary integrations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or UI elements). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
