  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be careful to ensure the generated code is executable and demonstrable. Using VC++ MFC 2022, develop a software for ceramic tile surface defect detection that automatically captures tile images using an industrial camera, then performs inference using a YOLOv model to produce results. Please help me design this project, including the interface and functionality, as well as user operations in specific detail. Also, provide the software code.",

      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements industrial camera SDK integration (such as Basler, FLIR, or Hikvision camera APIs) through MFC framework, including camera initialization, parameter configuration (exposure, gain, frame rate), real-time image capture, and buffer management. Check if the system supports multiple camera brands and provides camera status monitoring. Score 0 if camera integration is not implemented, 5 if only basic capture is implemented without parameter control, and 10 if full camera control with error handling is included.",

Check if the system supports model switching, batch processing, and GPU acceleration. Deduct 5 points if inference time exceeds 500ms per image, 3 points if confidence threshold is not configurable.

Evaluate if the system provides result export functionality (XML/JSON/CSV formats), defect image cropping, and historical result database storage.

Check if the system provides calibration tools, ROI selection, and inspection parameter adjustment.

Code with strong robustness should include proper exception handling, resource cleanup, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points if fully robust, 5 points if partially handled, and 0 points if no exception handling is present.",

Function modules unrelated to defect detection (e.g., built-in games or entertainment features) 3. Resource-intensive effects that impact real-time performance (e.g., unnecessary animations during detection).
