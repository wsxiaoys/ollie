  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure the generated code is executable. Help me create a web-based universal data calling template tool that connects to MySQL databases. The tool should allow users to visually drag database table fields into the tool and perform SQL query searches on the data. It should enable visual report creation, save report templates, automatically generate reports in the same format for different time periods, and allow creation of different templates.",

Check if the implementation includes database configuration options, SSL support, and connection timeout settings. Score 0 if connection functionality is missing, 5 if basic connection is implemented without security measures, and 10 if a complete, secure, and robust connection system is implemented with proper error handling.",

Check if it includes field metadata display, proper visual feedback during drag operations, and accurate drop target handling. The interface should correctly render different field types with appropriate icons.
