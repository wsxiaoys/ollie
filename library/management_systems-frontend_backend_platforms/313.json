  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Build a modern test case management platform with these core functions: user system, case management system, and case statistics system. Implement features for adding, modifying, and importing test cases via Excel. Execute test cases and generate execution statistics. Frontend tech stack: Vue.js + Bootstrap, etc. Backend tech stack: Django + Django REST framework, etc. Database: SQLite3, etc. Based on these requirements, what questions and suggestions do you have?",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements a clear separation of concerns with proper frontend-backend architecture. The frontend should use Vue.js component structure with proper state management, and the backend should follow Django's MVT pattern with REST API endpoints. Score 0 if the architecture is missing or fundamentally flawed, 5 if basic structure exists with some issues, and 10 if the architecture is comprehensive with proper separation of concerns.",
