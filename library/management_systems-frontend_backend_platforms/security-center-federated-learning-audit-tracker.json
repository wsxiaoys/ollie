      "description": "Review whether the participant status dashboard accurately displays real-time heartbeat detection with proper connection state visualization. Check if encryption protocol performance monitoring includes comprehensive metrics display (Paillier encryption time curves, throughput graphs, error rates). Score 0 if dashboard lacks real-time updates, 5 if only basic status display is implemented, and 10 if complete monitoring with historical data analysis is included.",

Check for operation filtering capabilities and timeline scrubbing. Deduct 5 points if playback lacks accuracy, 3 points if timeline navigation is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether parameter comparison functionality includes visual diff rendering, side-by-side comparison views, and change impact analysis. Check for color-coded modifications, expandable nested object comparisons, and export capabilities. Deduct 5 points if visual highlighting is poor, 3 points if complex nested changes aren't handled properly. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for data encryption at rest, proper indexing strategies, and backup mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if data integrity isn't guaranteed, 3 points if query performance is suboptimal.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as network timeouts, invalid data formats, concurrent access conflicts, encryption failures, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases in security-critical environments, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to security monitoring (e.g., built-in games or entertainment features) 3. Fancy effects that impact dashboard performance (e.g., excessive animations on critical monitoring displays).
