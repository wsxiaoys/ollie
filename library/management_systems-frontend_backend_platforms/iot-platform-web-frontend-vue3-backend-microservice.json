      "description": "Examine whether the code follows Vue3 best practices: Composition API usage, reactive state management, lifecycle hooks integration, and proper component composition. Check for single-responsibility components and proper prop validation. Deduct 5 points if useSetup() is missing where beneficial; deduct 5 points if reactive() and ref() are misused; deduct 3 points if component hierarchy is unnecessarily deep (>4 levels). Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether Element Plus components are properly utilized: lazy loading of components, on-demand importing, theme customization, responsive layouts, and proper form validation. Check if UI components match the application's requirements without overengineering. Deduct 5 points for global imports that cause bundle bloat; deduct 3 points for inadequate form validation; deduct 5 points for inconsistent component styling. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether ECharts visualizations are properly configured: responsive resizing, appropriate chart types for data representation, performance optimization for large datasets, and interactive features. Charts should provide meaningful insights into IoT data. Deduct 5 points if charts are not resizable; deduct 5 points for inappropriate chart types; deduct 3 points for missing tooltips or legends; deduct 5 points if real-time data updates aren't handled efficiently.

      "description": "Review the frontend-backend integration: proper API call patterns (Axios/Fetch), error handling, authentication token management, and response parsing. Check for RESTful practices and efficient data fetching strategies. Deduct 5 points for missing loading states; deduct 3 points for improper error handling; deduct 5 points for inefficient data fetching (no pagination/caching); deduct 5 points if authentication headers aren't properly managed.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as network failures, invalid API responses, data validation errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle edge cases like offline operation modes for IoT platforms. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for average implementation, and 0 points if no exceptions are handled.",

Device digital twins with 3D visualization 4. Real-time collaborative monitoring). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple HTTP client wrappers) 2. Function modules unrelated to IoT monitoring (e.g., unnecessary animations) 3. Performance-heavy features that affect responsiveness (e.g., excessive real-time polling without throttling). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state is overused; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate exceeds 30%; deduct 5 points if there's no CI/CD configuration. Full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for laggy dashboard updates, 3 points for jarring transitions between views, and 5 points for confusing navigation paths. Check for skeleton screens during loading and optimistic UI updates. Full score is 10 points.",
