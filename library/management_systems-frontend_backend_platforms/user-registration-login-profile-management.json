      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements complete registration logic including form validation (email format, password strength, username uniqueness), server-side verification, email confirmation mechanism, and duplicate account prevention. Score 0 if core registration flow is missing, 5 if only basic form submission is implemented, and 10 if all validation rules and security measures are fully included.",

Two-way token validation between front-end and back-end is required. Deduct 5 points if password hashing is missing, and 3 points if session timeout is not handled. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to user management (e.g., built-in games or unrelated widgets) 3. Excessive animations that affect performance (e.g., heavy particle effects on every interaction). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if sensitive data is exposed in client-side code or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if security best practices are ignored.
