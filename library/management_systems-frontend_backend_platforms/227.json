Create a Java-based picture book library borrowing system code, send me the complete source code that is not duplicated from online sources. Include web pages and layout elements. The quality should be at the graduation project level. The development tool is Eclipse.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements essential functionalities: user management, book catalog, borrowing/returning process, and reservation system. Score 0 if the core functions are missing, 5 if only basic CRUD operations are implemented, and 10 if it includes advanced features like fine calculation, borrowing history tracking, and book status management.",

Check for proper SQL query optimization and connection pooling. Deduct 5 points for missing transaction handling, 3 points for SQL injection vulnerabilities, and 2 points for inefficient query design. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate the use of appropriate Java web technologies (JSP, Servlet, JSF, or Spring MVC). Deduct 5 points if core pages are missing, 3 points if form validation is inadequate.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to library management (e.g., built-in games) 3. Resource-intensive features that affect performance (e.g., unnecessarily complex animations).
