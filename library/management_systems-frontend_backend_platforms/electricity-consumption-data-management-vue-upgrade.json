  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable when possible. Provide functionality for manual entry of historical electricity consumption data for various company yards in 2022 and 2023. Input information includes electricity consumption category, equipment code, equipment name, energy consumption, workload, unit consumption, electricity consumption month, and other information. The functionality should include adding, modifying, editing, deleting, importing, and exporting yard electricity consumption data.\n\nThe frontend needs to be upgraded from Vue 2.0 to Vue 3.0, and the functionality migrated to the Yuheng development framework. Adjust functional components and styles to adapt to the new framework, and switch the usage methods of common entity classes and utility classes to ensure comprehensive adjustment and adaptation of code functionality.",

Check for field type enforcement, range validation, and required field handling. Score 0 if core data structures are missing, 5 if basic fields are implemented but lack validation, and 10 if complete with comprehensive validation.",

Function modules unrelated to electricity consumption tracking (e.g., unnecessary animations or widgets) 3. Performance-impacting features that don't add value to the core functionality.
