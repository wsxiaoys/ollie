      "description": "Verify if the code correctly implements EPUB parsing (extracting content, metadata, TOC from .epub files) and renders HTML/CSS content from EPUB files. Score 0 if core parsing is missing, 5 if basic content display works but with formatting issues, and 10 if it properly handles EPUB 2.0/3.0 standards including complex layouts, embedded fonts, and media overlays.",

Deduct 2 points for each missing core navigation feature. Score 10 only if the navigation is both complete and intuitive with keyboard shortcuts, touch gestures, and visual indicators.",

Check if the TypeScript types are correctly defined for Electron API interactions. Deduct 5 points if process separation is incorrect, 3 points if TypeScript interfaces are missing/incorrect, and 3 points if Vite configuration doesn't handle Electron's development and production builds properly.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to e-reading (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down page turning). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if TypeScript is used incorrectly or inconsistently; deduct 3 points if components are tightly coupled; deduct 3 points if state management is chaotic; deduct 2 points if the build process is not optimized for both development and production.
