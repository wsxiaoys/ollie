      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a comprehensive product display system through HTML/JavaScript, including product catalog management, search/filter functionality, and detailed product information views. Check if it supports multiple product categories, image galleries, and product specifications display. Score 0 if basic product listing is missing, 5 if only static product display is implemented, and 10 if full interactive product showcase with filtering, sorting, and detailed views is included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the system provides distinct ordering workflows for different business scenarios (e.g., bulk orders, subscription orders, custom orders). Check if scenario-specific validation rules, pricing models, and order configurations are implemented. The system should dynamically adapt UI elements and available options based on selected scenarios. Deduct 5 points if scenario switching is not smooth, and 3 points if scenario-specific business logic is incomplete. Full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if the system uses proper templating mechanisms, supports dynamic clause insertion based on order specifics, and generates contracts in standard formats (PDF/Word). Deduct 5 points if contract templates are static without dynamic content, and 5 points if generated contracts contain formatting errors or missing critical information. Full score is 10 points.",

Check if the system provides order draft saving, modification workflows, and proper state transitions. Deduct 5 points if order persistence is not implemented, and 3 points if order modification/cancellation mechanisms are missing. Give 10 points if fully implemented with proper state management.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core business (e.g., built-in social media sharing) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during order processing).
