      "description": "Review whether the code implements essential gas management features including gas source tracking, pipeline management, leak detection, and monitoring dashboards. Score 0 if core features are missing, 5 if basic features are implemented without integration, and 10 if all essential features are fully integrated with real-time data visualization.",

Deduct 3 points if map initialization fails, 3 points for incorrect projection setup, and 4 points if custom gas infrastructure overlays are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if TypeScript is barely used, 5 if basic typing exists but with 'any' types, and 10 if comprehensive type definitions are present with proper interfaces for all data structures and strict typing throughout the application.",

Code with strong robustness should include error boundaries, fallback UI components, and comprehensive input validation. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for average implementation, and 0 points if exceptions are not handled.",

Function modules unrelated to gas management (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations on critical monitoring screens).
