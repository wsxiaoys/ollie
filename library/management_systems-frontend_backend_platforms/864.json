      "description": "Review whether the code implements a proper data structure for knowledge storage (e.g., relational database, document storage, graph database) with CRUD operations. Check if the code includes proper indexing for efficient knowledge retrieval and supports both structured and unstructured data. Score 0 if core storage functionality is missing, 5 if basic storage is implemented but lacks advanced retrieval, and 10 if the system includes comprehensive storage with efficient indexing and search capabilities.",

Check if it supports metadata management, custom taxonomies, and dynamic reorganization of knowledge. Deduct 5 points if the system doesn't support flexible categorization, 3 points if it lacks relationship management, and 2 points if it doesn't handle metadata effectively. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should include input validation, error handling, and data integrity checks. Give 10 points if robustness is comprehensive, 5 points if basic error handling exists, and 0 points if exceptions are not handled properly.",

Function modules unrelated to knowledge management (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
