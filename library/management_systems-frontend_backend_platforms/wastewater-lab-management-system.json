Create a Laboratory Information Management System suitable for wastewater treatment plant laboratories using Vue, Express, and MySQL. The system should include user login with role-based permissions, water quality testing, personnel management, equipment management, and reagent management.",

Check for password policy enforcement. Score 0 if authentication is missing, 5 if basic authentication exists but lacks proper role-based controls, and 10 if a complete, secure authentication system with fine-grained permissions is implemented.",

Deduct 3 points if regulatory compliance tracking is missing, 3 points if quality control standards aren't implemented, and 2 points if trend analysis visualization is absent.

Check for traceability between resources and tests. Deduct 3 points for each major module not implemented or poorly integrated. Give 10 points only if all three systems work cohesively with automated notifications and cross-module dependencies.",

Verify database schema design with appropriate relationships and constraints.

Check for input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to laboratory management (e.g., a built-in game for staff) 3. Overly complex features that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary real-time updates for static data).
