      "description": "Review whether the code properly initializes a Vue project using HBuilder, includes the Vue framework configuration (Vue 2 or Vue 3), and sets up the necessary project structure. Check if Vue Router and Vuex/Pinia are properly integrated. Score 0 if the Vue framework is not correctly initialized, 5 if basic Vue setup is present but with configuration issues, and 10 if the Vue framework is fully configured with proper module organization.",

Check if permissions are verified at both router navigation guards and component levels.

Examine if the components are properly organized with consistent props and emit patterns. Deduct 3 points if component reusability is poor, 4 points if UI framework is not utilized effectively, and 5 points if the component hierarchy is overly complex or flat.

Code with strong robustness should include form validations, defensive programming patterns, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for partial implementation, and 0 points if error handling is absent.",
