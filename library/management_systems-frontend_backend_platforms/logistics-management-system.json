  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. ======== Role ========\nYou are an experienced code expert. You have been given a software development requirement description and are required to generate project code according to these requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code that is fully annotated with simple, easy-to-understand language, without outputting anything else.\n\n======== Output Rules ========\n1. Always generate complete, runnable project code, ensuring the project is fully executable\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete, do not omit any code\n3. Carefully review and check all code before final output, evaluating its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, regenerate it\n4. If the requirement involves external API access or needs to use user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide mock data\n\n======== Project Requirements ========\nPlease write code to implement a logistics management system where administrators can track cargo transportation status, manage transport vehicles and driver information; customers can log in to view their cargo status and transportation logs.",

Function modules unrelated to logistics management (e.g., built-in games or unnecessary social features) 3.
