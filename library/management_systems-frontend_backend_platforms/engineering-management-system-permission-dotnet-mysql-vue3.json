      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with multiple permission levels, dynamic role assignment, and hierarchical permission inheritance. Check if it includes user-role mapping, permission validation middleware, and audit logging. Score 0 if core permission logic is missing, 5 if only basic role assignment exists, and 10 if all enterprise-grade permission features are implemented.",

Check if Entity Framework Core is correctly configured with MySQL, including migrations and data seeding.

Check for proper routing with navigation guards that integrate with the permission system.

Check for proper exception handling in both frontend and backend. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to engineering management (e.g., social media features) 3. Overengineered components that reduce maintainability.
