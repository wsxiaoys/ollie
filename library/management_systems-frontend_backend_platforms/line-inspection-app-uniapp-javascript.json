  "question": "You are a coding expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure that the code you generate is executable. Help me design a line inspection application with a frontend implemented in UniApp and a backend developed in JavaScript. The app should allow users to upload inspection photos and submit issues encountered during the inspection process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code includes proper UniApp component structure, page navigation, lifecycle hooks, and responsive layout. Check for proper use of conditional rendering, data binding, and event handling within the Vue-based framework. Score 0 if fundamental UniApp structure is missing, 5 if basic functionality exists but lacks optimization for multiple platforms, and 10 if the code demonstrates cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, H5) with adaptive designs.",

Verify the code manages upload progress indicators, retry mechanisms on failure, and proper error handling. Deduct 4 points if image compression is missing, 3 points if upload progress tracking is not implemented, and 3 points if there's no offline photo storage for later upload.

Check for draft saving functionality and submission confirmation. Deduct 3 points if geolocation is not implemented, 4 points if the relationship between photos and issues is poorly managed, and 3 points if validation is inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the backend includes rate limiting, proper error handling with meaningful status codes, and logging capabilities.

Code with strong robustness should handle edge cases like device permission denials, low storage warnings, and offline mode operations. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if exceptions are unhandled.",

Automated issue categorization using image recognition 3. AR markers for spatial reference 4. Offline operation mode with synchronization).

Function modules unrelated to inspection tasks 3. Unnecessarily complex animations or effects that affect performance on mobile devices. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core inspection functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
