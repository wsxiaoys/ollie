  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to provide executable code whenever possible. Please write code to implement a software development documentation management system where developers can upload and manage API documentation, technical specifications, system design documents, etc. The system should support online Markdown editing, automatic generation of API interface documentation, and provide version management and change history tracking. Administrators should be able to assign project access permissions and manage team members.",

      "description": "Examine whether the code provides a complete Markdown editor with real-time preview, syntax highlighting, keyboard shortcuts, and image embedding. Check if the editor includes specialized technical documentation features like code block syntax highlighting, table formatting, and mathematical formula support. Score 0 if basic editor functions are missing, 5 if only basic Markdown is supported, and 10 if it includes advanced technical documentation features.",

Check whether it generates standardized documentation formats (OpenAPI/Swagger, JSDoc, etc.). Deduct 5 points if only one language is supported, 3 points if the generated documentation lacks examples, and 2 points if schema validation is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if it supports reverting to previous versions and maintains a complete audit trail. Deduct 5 points if branching is not supported, 3 points if visual diff is missing, and 3 points if there's no conflict resolution mechanism. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if it includes approval workflows, temporary access grants, and audit logging of permission changes. Deduct 5 points if only basic role assignments exist, 3 points if permission inheritance is not implemented, and 3 points if there's no audit trail for access changes. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to documentation management (e.g., a built-in chat system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations in the documentation UI).
