Check if background.js (main process) and Vue app initialization are correctly linked. Score 0 if no proper integration exists, 5 if basic setup is implemented but with architectural flaws, and 10 if the integration follows Electron best practices with clear process separation.",

Check for proper timeout configurations, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive error handling. Deduct 3 points if CORS handling is missing for external APIs, 3 points if no request/response interceptors are implemented, and 5 points if error states aren't properly managed.

Evaluate if proper security measures are in place when handling external data. Deduct 5 points if all network requests are made directly from the renderer process without security considerations, and 3 points if IPC communication lacks error handling.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
