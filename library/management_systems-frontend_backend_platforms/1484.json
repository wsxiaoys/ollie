Check if form validation is implemented for data editing. Deduct 3 points if pagination is missing, 3 points if sorting/filtering is absent, and 5 points if edit/delete operations are incomplete.

Deduct 5 points if monitoring is not real-time, 3 points if request details are insufficient, and 3 points if there's no way to filter or search through requests.
