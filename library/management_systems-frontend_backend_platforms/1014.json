  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable. Write a fully operational code for an age-friendly renovation consulting app with the following requirements:\n\n1. Free registration for part-time/full-time designers, with the platform taking a 10% commission from each design project fee.\n\n2. Designers can freely choose projects. After accepting a job, the platform takes 10% of the deposit, and the project will be listed on the platform.\n\n3. Clients can select designers based on style preferences, with past case studies available for reference. Style consultation is free. Based on client preferences, designers will create style concepts. To obtain initial design drafts (which only include effect renderings without dimensions, just a general layout), clients must pay a deposit of 30% of the total project amount. The platform takes a 10% commission from this deposit. The platform only provides design solutions and consultation, not renovation materials or labor.\n\n4. After signing a contract and paying the 30% deposit, clients can view preliminary renderings (without source files).\n\n5. If clients are satisfied with the design, they pay the remaining balance. Designers will then visit the site to make detailed adjustments, maintain ongoing communication, provide source files, and implement the design plan.\n\n6. Please help me identify any design considerations I may have overlooked.",
