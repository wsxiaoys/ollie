I want to develop several screens using the AutoNavi (Gaode) API with VUE3.\n\nFirst screen: Electronic Fence Management\nThe screen layout should be half data display area and half map. When I click on an electronic fence data entry, the map area should simultaneously display the electronic fence style. The screen should support adding, deleting, modifying, and querying electronic fences, and also allow customization directly on the map.",

Score 0 if no fence drawing is implemented, 5 if only basic shapes without editing capabilities, and 10 if all fence types are implemented with full editing functionality.",

Ensure synchronization between data entries and map visualization is working correctly (clicking a fence in the list highlights it on the map).
