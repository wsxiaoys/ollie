  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Implement a design draft review system that supports Sketch/PSD file preview, allows reviewers to select areas on design drawings and add comments, provides multi-version comparison views (with left-right sliding comparison), and automatically generates a summary document of modification suggestions (sorted by number of comments).",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements proper file uploading for Sketch/PSD files, handles file validation, and converts these design files into viewable formats (SVG/PNG) on the web interface. Check if there's progress indication during upload/conversion. Score 0 if there's no file handling, 5 if only basic upload exists without proper preview, and 10 if the system handles both Sketch and PSD files with proper preview rendering.",

Check if selection coordinates are properly stored and if selected areas remain visible when hovering over corresponding comments. Deduct 5 points if only rectangular selection is available, 3 points if selection coordinates aren't preserved across sessions, and 2 points if there's no visual indication of commented areas.

Verify if the left-right sliding comparison works smoothly with synchronized zooming/panning. Test if differences between versions are highlighted or can be automatically detected. Deduct 5 points if comparison view lacks synchronization between versions, 3 points if zooming causes misalignment, and 5 points if the slider mechanism is jerky or imprecise.

Evaluate if the summary can be exported in common formats (PDF, DOC).

Check if there's proper validation for all user inputs and API responses. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to design review (e.g., a built-in chat system unrelated to commenting) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow down the review process).
