      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the meeting room booking interface with essential components like calendar view, room selection, time slot picking, and booking form. Score 0 if core UI elements are missing, 5 if only basic interface is implemented without intelligent features, 10 if the complete system with intelligent recommendations and visual feedback is implemented.",

Deduct 5 points if the integration is superficial, 3 points if error handling for API calls is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to meeting room booking (e.g., a news feed) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary 3D animations).
