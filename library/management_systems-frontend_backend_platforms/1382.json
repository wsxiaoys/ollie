Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to gym management (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations).
