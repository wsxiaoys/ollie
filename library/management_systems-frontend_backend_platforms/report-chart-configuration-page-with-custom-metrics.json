Please regenerate the front-end for the report and chart configuration page. Requirements: 1) Include custom metrics, custom reports, and custom charts. Please refer to other successful cases. I want to implement a complex statistical report. After configuration is complete, it should be possible to see the configuration style of the report.",

      "description": "Review whether the code provides a complete custom metrics definition interface, including metric name, data source, calculation formula, filtering conditions, and aggregation methods. Check if the interface supports complex metric composition (derived metrics based on other metrics). Score 0 if the core metric definition logic is missing, 5 if only basic metric definition is available, and 10 if advanced features like conditional metrics and calculated fields are fully implemented.",

Check if the code implements template selection, layout customization, and conditional formatting rules.

Verify that chart customization includes axis labels, legends, tooltips, color schemes, and interactive features (zoom, drill-down, etc.). Deduct 5 points if responsive design for different screen sizes is missing, and 3 points if accessibility features are not considered. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if configuration changes immediately reflect in the visualization without requiring page reloads. The implementation should include data caching mechanisms and optimized rendering to prevent performance issues. Give 10 points for seamless live updates with minimal latency, 5 points if updates require manual refresh, and 0 if preview functionality is missing.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to reporting (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations in the configuration interface).
