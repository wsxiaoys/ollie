Check if items can be filtered or searched. Deduct 5 points if the menu is just a flat list without categories, 3 points if item details are incomplete, and 2 points if no search/filter functionality exists. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to food ordering (e.g., a built-in game while waiting) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when adding items to cart).
