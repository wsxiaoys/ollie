      "description": "Check if the code includes proper Vue3 initialization using createApp, proper configuration of Vue Router, and correct loading of Element Plus. Verify that the package.json includes the correct dependencies (vue@^3.x, element-plus, vue-router@^4.x), and that vite.config.js or vue.config.js is properly set up. Score 0 if Vue3 is not correctly configured, 5 if basic setup exists but is incomplete, and 10 if full configuration with proper imports, plugin registration, and environment variables is present.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether Element Plus components are properly imported (either globally or on-demand with auto imports), theme customization is implemented, and icon libraries are correctly set up. Check if CSS imports for Element Plus are correctly placed in main.js or index.html. Deduct 5 points if the importing strategy leads to bundle bloat, 3 points if theme configuration is missing, and 2 points if icon setup is incorrect. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the sidebar menu is collapsible and if the layout adapts to different screen sizes. Score 0 if no dashboard layout is implemented, 5 if basic layout exists but lacks responsiveness, and 10 if a fully responsive, well-structured dashboard with proper navigation components is implemented.",

Check for separation of concerns between views and state, and verify that dashboard data is properly reactive. Deduct 5 points if global state is mismanaged, 3 points if props/emits are improperly used, and 5 points if reactivity isn't properly leveraged. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as API failures, loading states, form validation errors) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should include try/catch blocks, error boundaries, and loading indicators. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling and input validation, 5 points if basic error handling exists, and 0 points if exceptions are not handled at all.",

Interactive data visualizations 4. Keyboard shortcuts for common operations). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Heavy animations or effects that affect performance. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if component coupling is too high; deduct 5 points if naming conventions are inconsistent; deduct 5 points if no ESLint/Prettier configuration is present.

Deduct 3 points for each inconsistent UI element, 5 points for misaligned components, and 5 points for inconsistent use of Element Plus styling. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for missing loading states during data fetching, 3 points for abrupt page transitions, and 5 points for unresponsive UI during heavy operations. The full score is 10 points.",
