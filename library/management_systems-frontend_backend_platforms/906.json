      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements comprehensive asset management features including asset creation, editing, deletion, categorization, and search functionality. Check if asset metadata management (name, description, tags, creation date, file size, etc.) is properly handled. Score 0 if core CRUD operations are missing, 5 if only basic operations are implemented, and 10 if full asset lifecycle management with advanced filtering and bulk operations are included.",

Check if data validation, error handling for data operations, and state management (Vuex/Pinia) are correctly implemented. Deduct 5 points if data validation is insufficient, 3 points if no backup/recovery mechanism exists. Full score requires robust data integrity and proper state synchronization.",

Check if components are properly structured with props/events, utilize composition API effectively, and implement proper component lifecycle management. Deduct 5 points if components are tightly coupled, 3 points if props validation is missing. Requires modular, maintainable component hierarchy with proper data flow.",

Check if navigation is intuitive with proper routing (Vue Router), breadcrumbs, and user guidance. Assessment includes workflow efficiency, task completion paths, and user onboarding elements. Deduct 5 points if navigation is confusing, 3 points if no loading states or progress indicators exist. Full score requires seamless user experience with clear action paths.",

Robust code should gracefully handle edge cases with proper error boundaries and fallback UI states.
