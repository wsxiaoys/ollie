      "description": "Evaluate whether the Vue3 + TypeScript implementation correctly handles the core BPMN 2.0 elements (tasks, gateways, events, sequence flows, etc.) and their properties. Check if the elements maintain proper BPMN 2.0 compliance and semantics according to the OMG specification. Score 0 if basic elements are missing, 5 if implementation is incomplete, 10 if full BPMN 2.0 element coverage is provided.",

Test with sample files to check if all diagram elements and their attributes are preserved during import/export cycles. Deduct 5 points if XML namespaces are improperly handled, 3 points if non-standard extensions aren't properly managed. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper component organization, avoiding unnecessary component rendering, and appropriate use of provide/inject for deep component communication. Deduct 5 points for incorrect reactivity implementation, 3 points for improper TypeScript type definitions. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Review whether the implementation supports standard BPMN interaction patterns such as drag-and-drop creation of elements, context menus for property editing, connection handling between elements, and resizing/repositioning capabilities. Check if the diagram interaction follows BPMN modeling tool conventions. Deduct 5 points if interaction feels clunky or unintuitive, 3 points if standard keyboard shortcuts are missing.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as malformed BPMN XML, invalid user inputs, overlapping elements, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should prevent diagram corruption and data loss. Give 10 points if exceptional cases are handled comprehensively, 5 points if basic error handling exists, and 0 points if exceptions are unhandled.",

Over-engineered solutions that could be simplified. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if redundant code interferes with core BPMN functionality or significantly impacts performance.",
