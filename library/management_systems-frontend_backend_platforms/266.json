  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Create a UI project using QT based on Palantir's style with web interface development as the foundation. This project should include Palantir's main elements and facilitate easy modification of styles, language switching between Chinese and English, etc. How can this be implemented? Please provide specific and complete code.",

Check if the bridge between Qt C++ and web components is correctly implemented with proper data binding. Score 0 if there's no integration between Qt and web, 5 if basic integration exists but with limitations, and 10 if there's seamless two-way communication between Qt and web components.",

Score based on completeness: 0 points if no Palantir styling is present, 5 points if basic styling elements are included, 10 points if the UI closely resembles Palantir's professional interface with attention to shadows, borders, and spacing.",

Check for separation of style definitions (CSS/SCSS or Qt style sheets), theme manager implementation, and runtime style switching capability.
