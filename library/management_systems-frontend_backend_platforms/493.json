  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable and can be demonstrated. Develop a personal knowledge base management tool where users can create different knowledge categories, add notes (supporting Markdown format), upload and manage related files, and add tags and search functionality to content. Support link references between content, note version history viewing, and import/export functions for knowledge points. The interface should support toggling between dark and light modes.",

Check if the data model includes proper relationships between knowledge entities. Score 0 if core functionality is missing, 5 if basic note creation/editing exists but lacks hierarchical organization, and 10 if the full knowledge structure with parent-child relationships and cross-references is implemented.",

Check if the editor provides toolbar shortcuts for common Markdown functions and proper handling of special characters.

Search functionality should support complex queries (by tag, content, title, date), provide instant results, and highlight matched terms.

Function modules unrelated to knowledge management (e.g., built-in games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during note transitions).
