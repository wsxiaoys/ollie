  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. I am refining my master's thesis, which mainly focuses on: exploring user needs through multiple dimensions and designing responses accordingly. The primary method involves analyzing user interview records and online review data using text data analysis to understand users' basic requirements for customized furniture, and on this basis, conducting research on both structural and aesthetic aspects of customized furniture configuration design. For the structural module configuration of customized furniture, association rule mining algorithms are used to deeply extract component association rules from the company's historical sales records, thereby building a rule base for customized furniture component configuration and forming customized furniture configuration modules categorized by functionality. For the aesthetic configuration design of customized furniture, eye-tracking experiments are conducted to study users' intuitive search mechanisms when observing customized furniture in both single-element stimuli and composite scene stimuli, and to classify users according to their subjective style preferences and objective visual preferences. Finally, combining the results of structural and aesthetic configuration design research, a recommendation system for customized furniture configuration design is built based on a rule engine. Currently, I have reached the system-building stage and plan to present it as a WeChat Mini Program. I have already registered with APPAid. As I have no coding background, I need specific and detailed implementation guidance from the beginning. My current plan for the Mini Program consists of eight steps: 1. User selects the required cabinet function, including wardrobe, entrance cabinet, sideboard, bookcase, storage cabinet, and display cabinet. 2. User selects the number of cabinet units needed: 1, 2, 3, or 4 units. 3. User selects the structural form for each unit, which are pre-established 3D models. 4. Multiple units are combined to display the result. 5. User selects preferred styles, with options including natural, bright, minimalist, vintage, warm, comfortable, and modern, and can select two. 6. Based on the selected styles, recommend colors or textures for the cabinet and map them to the 3D model. 7. Display the result with 3D rotation interaction capability. 8. If unsatisfied, allow further customization of colors and textures.",
