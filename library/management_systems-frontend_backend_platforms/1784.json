Score 0 if critical information is missing, 5 if basic display is implemented but lacks formatting, and 10 if all details are properly formatted (e.g., currency formatted as 'Â¥44,000.00', account numbers partially masked).",

Check for features like PDF generation, print-friendly formatting, or save-to-file options.

Check for proper masking of account numbers (showing only last 4 digits), secure storage practices, and protection against data exposure.

Function modules unrelated to transfer records (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations).
