      "description": "Review whether the code implements a proper data structure for the knowledge base, including entities, relationships, and attributes. Check if it supports hierarchical organization, tagging, and searching capabilities. Score 0 if no proper data model exists, 5 if basic structures are implemented but lacking advanced features, and 10 if the design includes comprehensive indexing, versioning, and taxonomy support.",

Deduct 5 points if components are tightly coupled, 3 points if there's no separation of concerns, and 2 points if reusable components are not properly abstracted. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to knowledge management (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
