  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. I want to create an Excel spreadsheet for employees to fill in their daily work plans, with a perpetual calendar for selecting dates. It should have 7 windows displaying Monday through Sunday, where daily work plans can be entered. All employees will use the same spreadsheet, but it should be possible to select individual employees to view their work plans.",

      "description": "Review whether the calendar component accurately handles date selection, supports month/year navigation, and properly highlights weekends/holidays. Check if it correctly maps selected dates to the appropriate day-of-week columns. Score 0 if the calendar is not implemented, 5 if basic date picking works but has issues with edge cases (month boundaries, leap years), and 10 if it handles all date scenarios correctly including proper month/year transitions.",

Check that the system correctly populates content based on the selected week, with appropriate styling for current day, weekend days, and holidays. Deduct 5 points if days are mislabeled or inconsistently formatted; deduct 3 points if column widths are not optimized for content. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the dropdown/selection mechanism is functional, includes search capabilities for larger employee lists, and properly persists the selected employee across date changes. Deduct 5 points if employee filtering doesn't maintain state when navigating between weeks; deduct 3 points if there's no visual indication of which employee is currently selected.

Check if the implementation includes data validation, auto-save functionality, and undo/redo capabilities.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to work planning (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when switching between employees).
