      "title": "Is the core Fengchao (Smart Locker) system functionality implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the code properly implements the basic smart locker functionality including locker initialization, package placement, user authentication, and package retrieval. Score 0 if the core system logic is missing, 5 if only basic operations are implemented without proper state management, and 10 if the complete locker management system with proper state transitions is implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate the authentication mechanisms (QR codes, PIN codes, mobile verification) and the security measures implemented. Check for input validation, secure token generation, and proper authentication flow. Deduct 5 points if authentication is simplistic or trivial, 3 points if validation logic is incomplete. Look for proper encryption of sensitive data and timeout mechanisms for authentication attempts. Full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Is the locker status management and reservation system designed effectively?",
      "description": "Review how the system manages locker statuses (empty, occupied, reserved, maintenance) and the reservation logic. Check for race conditions handling, timeout mechanisms for unclaimed packages, and proper notification systems. Deduct 5 points if status transitions are incomplete, 3 points if reservation conflicts aren't handled. Give 10 points if the system includes comprehensive status management with proper error recovery.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code includes admin functionality for system monitoring, manual interventions, usage statistics, and maintenance operations. Check for dashboard visualization capabilities and alert mechanisms for system issues. Deduct 5 points if admin features are minimal, 3 points if monitoring capabilities are limited. Award 10 points for comprehensive admin features with detailed reporting.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as network failures, power outages, hardware malfunctions, invalid inputs, etc.) and provide graceful degradation or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should include error logging, retry mechanisms, and data persistence. Give 10 points if these are well implemented, 5 points if robustness is average, and 0 points if no exception handling exists.",

Integration with delivery tracking APIs 3. Smart notifications with estimated arrival times 4. Contactless biometric authentication). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple authentication systems that serve the same purpose) 2. Function modules unrelated to smart lockers (e.g., unrelated social networking features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow down the core functionality). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Inspect for design patterns appropriate for IoT/embedded systems. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if error handling is inconsistent. The full score is 10 points.",
