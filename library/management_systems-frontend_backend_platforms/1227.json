The Liangchibao mini-program code needs to allow on-site photo uploads with measurement data annotations, and special areas require text notes. Users publish measurement orders that staff members can accept and manage. There should also be backend management functionality. Please provide the complete detailed code.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements the complete photo upload flow including camera access permissions, compression, preview, and upload. Check if the code provides an intuitive interface for adding measurement annotations (like lengths, areas) directly on photos. Verify if annotations can be visually represented (lines, markers) with measurement data (values, units). Score 0 if basic upload is missing, 5 if upload works but annotations are limited, and 10 if the complete system with visual measurement tools is implemented.",

Check if the implementation includes: 1) Area selection tools (rectangular/freeform), 2) Text input mechanism tied to the selected area, 3) Visual representation showing the connection between notes and areas. Deduct 3 points if area selection is imprecise, 5 points if notes aren't visually linked to areas, and 3 points if text formatting options are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify if the system includes order parameters (location, requirements, deadline, pricing), status tracking, and notification mechanisms. For staff-side functionality, confirm if order acceptance, status updates, and completion reporting are implemented. Deduct 5 points if the workflow has gaps, 3 points if notification system is missing, and 3 points if order history/tracking is incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to measurement or order management (e.g., social networking features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
