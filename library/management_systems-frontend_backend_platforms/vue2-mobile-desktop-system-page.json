Check if the UI includes status bar elements (time, battery, signal), app icons with labels, and a dock/favorites bar at the bottom.

Evaluate the use of Vue lifecycle hooks. Deduct 3 points for global state without proper management, 3 points for prop drilling beyond 2 levels, and 4 points for not leveraging Vue reactivity system.

For a desktop system, app data, current page, and UI state should be properly managed.

Code with strong robustness should validate inputs, handle edge cases, and provide meaningful error messages or recovery mechanisms, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to mobile desktop (e.g., built-in games unrelated to the launcher) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or transitions).
