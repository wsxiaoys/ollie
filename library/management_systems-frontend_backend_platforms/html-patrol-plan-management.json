      "description": "Check if the code includes both preset route selection and custom route creation capabilities. The interface should display route options visually (e.g., on a map or as a list) and allow for interactive selection. For custom routes, verify if waypoint creation, modification, and deletion are supported. Score 0 if route selection is missing, 5 if only preset routes are available, and 10 if both preset and fully functional custom route creation are implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the time selection interface provides intuitive date and time pickers for both start and end times. Check if the implementation validates time inputs (preventing end time before start time), handles time zones appropriately, and offers recurring schedule options. Verify if the interface shows visual feedback for selected time periods. Score 0 if time settings are missing, 5 if basic time selection exists but lacks validation, and 10 if time selection is complete with validation and visual indicators.",

Check if the implementation allows multi-selection of patrol officers and displays their work hours/schedule conflicts. Verify if capacity planning (minimum/maximum officers per patrol) is enforced. Score 0 if personnel assignment is missing, 5 if basic selection exists without conflict checking, and 10 if it's fully implemented with availability checks and qualification filtering.",

Check if edited plans maintain their historical records and if deletion includes archiving options. Verify if the system prevents deletion of active patrols without supervisor confirmation. Score 0 if these operations are missing, 5 if they exist but lack validation or confirmation features, and 10 if they're fully implemented with all safety measures.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Mobile notifications for patrol officers 4. AI-suggested optimal patrol routes based on historical incident data).

Function modules unrelated to patrol planning (e.g., an embedded social media feed) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow down the interface). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code doesn't adapt to different screen sizes.
