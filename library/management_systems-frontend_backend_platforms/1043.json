      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a coherent dashboard layout with appropriate sections for asset inventory, security status, risk distribution, and alert summaries. Check if the HTML structure uses semantic elements correctly (header, main, section, etc.). Score 0 if there's no clear dashboard structure, 5 if basic elements exist but lack organization, and 10 if the layout follows security dashboard best practices with logical information hierarchy.",

Assess whether appropriate visualization libraries are used (D3.js, Chart.js, etc.) and if the visualizations convey security insights clearly. Deduct 5 points if visualizations are static/non-interactive, 3 points if data binding is missing, and 2 points if accessibility features are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if searching/filtering is absent, 5 if basic search exists without advanced filters, and 10 if the implementation includes both search, multi-criteria filtering, and performant result handling.",

Check for proper error handling, data validation, and fallback displays. Code with strong robustness should handle all these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to security asset management (e.g., irrelevant system tools) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow dashboard loading). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global variable pollution is found or if design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance optimization techniques are used (e.g., lazy loading, pagination).
