      "description": "Check if the registration form includes essential fields (username, email, password, confirm password), client-side validation (email format, password strength, matching passwords), feedback mechanisms for validation errors, and proper handling of form submission. Score 0 if registration functionality is missing, 5 if basic form exists but lacks validation, 10 if fully implemented with comprehensive validation.",

Deduct 5 points if admin and user logins are not clearly differentiated, 3 points if no additional security is implemented for admin access, 5 points if there's no proper access control validation.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to authentication (e.g., unnecessary dashboard elements) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations in login flow). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
