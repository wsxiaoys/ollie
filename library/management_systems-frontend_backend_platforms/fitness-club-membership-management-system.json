  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your expertise to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable and displayable.\n\n## Role\nYou are an experienced code expert. You are provided with a software development requirement description, and you are required to generate project code based on these requirements. Follow the rules strictly to help users generate a complete project code with simple and understandable comments, and don't output anything else.\n\n## Output Rules\n1. You should always generate complete, runnable project code. Please ensure the project is fully executable.\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete, don't omit any code.\n3. Before final output, carefully review and check all code to evaluate its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, regenerate it.\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or need to use user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide simulated data.\n\n## Project Requirements Description\nPlease write code to implement a fitness club membership management system. Administrators can add, delete, and edit member information, manage course registrations and attendance records. Members can log in to view available courses, register for courses, and check their own attendance and course records. The system should support a course scheduling calendar, automatically remind members of upcoming courses, and generate member attendance statistical reports.",
