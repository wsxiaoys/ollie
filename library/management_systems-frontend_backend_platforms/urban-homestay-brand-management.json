  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the generated code is executable for display. I am now starting a business to create an urban homestay brand, with properties distributed across different neighborhoods, each with a different style. The investment amount is 300,000, with 3 staff members responsible for platform OTA operations, housekeeper customer service, and soft furnishing design, etc. Based on the above ideas and content, please help me generate a piece of HTML code. I don't understand how to write code, but need management that meets smart and intelligent urban homestay management!",

      "description": "Review whether the HTML code implements essential management features including property listing management, reservation tracking, occupancy calendar, and financial reporting. Score 0 if none of the core functions are implemented, 5 if only basic listing display is present, and 10 if a complete management dashboard with all key metrics is included.",

Verify if it allows synchronized calendar management across platforms and centralized booking management. Deduct 5 points if there's no real-time synchronization mechanism, and 3 points if listing information can't be updated across multiple platforms simultaneously. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the system allows for task assignment to the 3 staff members mentioned. Deduct 5 points if there's no notification system for urgent issues, and 3 points if cleaning verification protocols are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the system supports the soft furnishing design staff member's work with design templates or mockup tools.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to homestay management (e.g., a built-in game for guests) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations on critical management pages).

Deduct 5 points if global variable pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the interface doesn't adapt to different screen sizes.
