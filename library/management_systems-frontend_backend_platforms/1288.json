      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements multi-format file upload (PDF, DOC, DOCX, images) with proper file validation, size limits, and storage mechanisms. Check if file management includes operations like view, download, delete, and categorization. Score 0 if core upload functionality is missing, 5 if only basic upload is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive file management with metadata handling is fully included.",

Evaluate if search results are properly paginated and sorted. Two-way verification between front-end filtering and back-end queries is required. Deduct 5 points if full-text search is missing, and 3 points if search performance is not optimized. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if secure login/logout mechanisms are implemented with proper password encryption. Deduct 5 points if JWT token management is missing. Check whether user session timeout and security measures are implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to document management (e.g., a built-in social media feed) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during file processing). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
