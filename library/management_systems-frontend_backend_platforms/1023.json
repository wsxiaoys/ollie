The system's \"Historical Business\" interface. The function bar at the top supports searching processes through different methods: process name \"supports fuzzy search\"; process code \"does not support fuzzy search\"; creation time \"select start time\"; business type \"select business type\". Below the search bar are two buttons \"Search\" and \"Reset\". At the bottom of the interface is a menu table with columns: \"Process Name\", \"Task Name\", \"Initiator\", \"Handler\", \"Creation Time\", \"End Time\", \"Duration\", and \"Operation (History)\".\nBased on the above description, please help me write a frontend code snippet using Vue.",

Check if the search logic properly filters data based on these criteria.
