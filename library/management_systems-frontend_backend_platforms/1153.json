  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Ensure that the code you generate is executable and functional. Create an online approval workflow management system for an office platform using front-end technologies, with support for custom form templates. Build the interactive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the approval workflow page, users should be able to design form templates themselves to meet diverse approval requirements. Display approval process progress in real-time, enabling monitoring and management of each approval stage. When new approval data is generated, the system status should update in real-time, dynamically changing the color or style of approval nodes to visually reflect the progress of the approval process.",

      "description": "Check whether the code implements a complete form template builder that allows users to drag-and-drop form elements, customize field types (text, numbers, dates, dropdowns, etc.), set validations, and save templates. Score 0 if the builder is not implemented, 5 if only basic field addition is possible, and 10 if the full WYSIWYG editor with preview functionality is implemented.",

Check if it includes features like timeout settings and escalation rules. Deduct 3 points if the workflow lacks conditional logic, 4 points if it doesn't support parallel approvals, and 3 points if there's no way to visualize the complete workflow.

Check if the visualization updates in real-time without page refresh. Deduct 5 points if the visualization is static (requires refresh), and 5 points if status changes aren't visually distinct.
