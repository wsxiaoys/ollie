      "description": "Review whether the code correctly utilizes React 18's new features including Concurrent Features, Automatic Batching, and Suspense for data fetching. Check if the project structure follows modern React patterns with proper component composition and hooks usage. Score 0 if using outdated React patterns, 5 if basic React 18 setup without new features, and 10 if fully leveraging React 18's capabilities including Concurrent Rendering and new APIs.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether Ant Design components are properly integrated with consistent theming, proper ConfigProvider setup, and customized design tokens. Check if the implementation includes responsive design, proper form validation, and accessibility features. Deduct 5 points if default styling is used without customization, 3 points if responsive breakpoints are not handled properly. Full score requires complete theme customization and component optimization.",

Evaluate if breadcrumb navigation, multi-tab support, and permission-based menu rendering are included. Deduct 5 points if basic layout structure is missing, 3 points if route guards are not implemented. Full score requires complete admin template features including settings drawer and layout customization.",

Check if middleware setup includes proper debugging tools, persistence layer, and normalized state structure. Deduct 5 points if using legacy Redux patterns, 3 points if state normalization is poor. Full score requires RTK Query integration, proper error handling, and optimistic updates.",

Code with strong robustness should include proper loading states, error boundaries, and graceful degradation, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no error handling is implemented, give 0 points.",

Real-time dashboard with WebSocket updates 3. Drag-and-drop form builder 4. Advanced search with filters 5. Bulk operations with progress tracking).

Unused dependencies or features unrelated to backend management 3. Over-engineered solutions that complicate simple tasks. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core admin functionalities are hindered by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if TypeScript types are poorly defined or any type is overused; deduct 5 points if no testing strategy is implemented; deduct 5 points if build optimization and code splitting are not configured.

Deduct 3 points for each cluttered interface section, 5 points for poor color contrast or accessibility issues, and 5 points for inconsistent spacing or typography.

Deduct 5 points for each interaction without proper feedback, 3 points for jerky animations or transitions, and 5 points for unclear navigation flow. Full score requires seamless, intuitive user experience.",
