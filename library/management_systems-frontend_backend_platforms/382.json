      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements essential accounting features such as income/expense tracking, category management, balance calculation, and transaction recording. Score 0 if no accounting functions are present, 5 if only basic transactions are supported, and 10 if the system includes comprehensive accounting features (transaction history, categorization, searching).",

      "description": "Check if the code follows Qt best practices including proper signal-slot connections, appropriate use of Qt widgets, and correct implementation of the Qt event loop. Deduct 5 points if the code doesn't utilize Qt's object model correctly, and 3 points for failing to follow Qt naming conventions. Verify if the code uses appropriate Qt modules (QtWidgets, QtCore, etc.).",

Deduct 5 points if there's no data persistence, 3 points if data is saved but without proper error handling. Full score requires proper initialization, data validation, and recovery mechanisms.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the UI includes essential accounting elements like transaction input forms, balance displays, report views, and filtering options. Check if the layout is logical with clear visual hierarchy. Deduct 5 points if critical financial information isn't clearly presented, and 3 points if the workflow is confusing.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to accounting (e.g., a built-in calculator when Qt already provides this) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if memory management is poor (Qt parent-child relationships not managed properly). The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for transactions without confirmation feedback, 3 points for laggy interface when handling large datasets, and 5 points for hard-to-find critical financial controls.
