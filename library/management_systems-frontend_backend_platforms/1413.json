  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure to ensure that the generated code is executable and displayable. I have implemented a switching effect for a login/registration page where when a user clicks on the login or registration button, an overlay appears containing a form where the user can enter their username and password, then click the submit button to login or register. When the user clicks the return button, the overlay is hidden, and the login or registration form is displayed in the main area. This effect can improve user experience, making it more convenient for users to login or register. Please implement the above code.",

      "description": "Check if the code properly implements the switching mechanism between login and registration forms with overlay functionality. Verify that clicking on login/registration buttons shows the appropriate overlay with form, and clicking return hides the overlay displaying the form in the main area. Score 0 if the switching effect isn't implemented, 5 if only basic toggling is present, and 10 if smoothly transitions between states with proper visibility control.",
