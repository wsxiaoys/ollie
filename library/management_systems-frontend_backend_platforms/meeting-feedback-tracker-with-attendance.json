  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration whenever possible. I need to create a webpage for tracking feedback from meeting participants with the following features: 1. Ability to import multiple attendance lists containing departments, personnel, and phone numbers. 2. The webpage should be able to compile and summarize departments, personnel, and phone numbers. 3. Remove duplicate entries, and implement this in an intranet environment.",

      "description": "Review whether the code provides multiple methods for importing attendance data (CSV, Excel, JSON, manual entry), handles various file formats correctly, and includes proper error handling for malformed data. Check if the import validates the required fields (departments, personnel, phone numbers). Score 0 if import functionality is missing, 5 if only basic import is available, and 10 if multiple import methods with validation are implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code properly compiles and summarizes the imported data, providing statistical information by department, personnel counts, and contact information. Check if the system offers sorting, filtering, and search capabilities. Score 0 if summarization is missing, 5 if basic compilation exists but lacks advanced features, and 10 if comprehensive data summarization with multiple viewing options is implemented.",

      "description": "Assess the duplicate detection algorithm to confirm it can identify duplicate entries based on multiple criteria (exact matches, fuzzy matching on names, similar phone numbers). Verify that the system allows for manual review of potential duplicates before removal and maintains an audit log of merged/removed entries. Deduct 5 points if only exact matching is used, and 3 points if no user confirmation for removal exists. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the implementation works entirely client-side or uses minimal server requirements suitable for intranet deployment. Verify that it doesn't rely on external services, CDNs, or APIs that would be inaccessible in an isolated network. Evaluate if local storage or internal database options are properly implemented for data persistence. Score 0 if incompatible with intranet, 5 if partially compatible with modifications needed, and 10 if fully intranet-ready.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as malformed input data, missing fields, network interruption, user operation errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to attendance tracking (e.g., a built-in calendar system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations or transitions).
