Verify if semantic HTML5 elements are used appropriately (table, thead, tbody, etc.). Table should include proper column headers and data cells for patrol records. Deduct 5 points if basic structure is missing, 3 points if semantic HTML is not used, 2 points if accessibility attributes are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to reliability testing (e.g., unrelated animations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or transitions).
