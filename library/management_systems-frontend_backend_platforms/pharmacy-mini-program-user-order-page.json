  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate, professional responses. Be sure to provide executable code where possible. Please help me create a frontend page for a pharmacy store mini-program, which should include user information, a login button, and four order status categories (unpaid, in progress, to be received, and completed). The function menu should include history records, favorites, my customer service, my orders, shipping address, and settings.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements a complete user authentication flow including login button functionality, session management, and secure token storage. Check if there's proper handling of authentication states (logged in/out) and user information display. Score 0 if no authentication logic exists, 5 if basic login UI is present without functionality, 10 if a complete secure authentication system is implemented with proper state management.",

Check if the code includes state transitions between categories and proper data binding. Deduct 3 points if any category is missing, 2 points if visual distinction is poor, and 2 points if state transitions are not implemented. Full score is 10 points.",

Each missing feature deducts 1.5 points. Check if each menu item has appropriate icons and leads to the correct functionality. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points if the design is generic without pharmacy-specific elements, 3 points if inappropriate terminology is used, and 4 points if the context is completely mismatched.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to a pharmacy mini-program (e.g., gaming features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations on critical paths).
