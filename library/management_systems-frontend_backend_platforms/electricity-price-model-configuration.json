Based on this information, could you help me create a product prototype for an \"Electricity Price Model Configuration Module\"? Either provide an image directly or give me an HTML file that I can open in my browser myself.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements configurable electricity pricing models through HTML/JavaScript, including time-of-use (TOU) pricing, tiered pricing, demand charges, and seasonal rate adjustments. Check if the interface allows users to set multiple rate periods, define price thresholds, and configure complex pricing structures. Score 0 if no pricing model configuration is implemented, 5 if only basic single-rate configuration exists, and 10 if comprehensive multi-tier pricing models with time-based variations are fully supported.",

Check if the code includes validation for price configuration conflicts, automatic calculation of blended rates, and graphical representation of price structures. Deduct 5 points if calculation logic is missing or incorrect, and 3 points if no visual feedback is provided for price changes. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the prototype includes proper data structure for storing pricing configurations, supports import/export of pricing templates, and provides version control for different pricing schemes. Evaluate if the system can handle multiple utility rate schedules and allows for easy switching between configurations. Deduct 5 points if no data persistence is implemented, and 3 points if configuration templates cannot be saved or loaded. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Review whether the code includes comprehensive validation for pricing model consistency, conflict detection between overlapping rate periods, and scenario testing capabilities. Check if the system provides simulation tools to test pricing models against sample usage data and generates accuracy reports. Deduct 5 points if no validation logic exists, and 3 points if edge cases in pricing periods are not handled. Give 10 points if fully implemented with comprehensive testing scenarios.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid price inputs, overlapping time periods, negative rates, extreme values, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should effectively validate all user inputs, handle edge cases gracefully, and prevent system crashes from malformed data, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Smart pricing recommendations based on usage patterns 3. Real-time cost impact visualization 4. Pricing model comparison tools).

Function modules unrelated to electricity pricing (e.g., weather widgets or unrelated utilities) 3. Fancy effects that affect usability (e.g., excessive animations during price configuration). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core pricing configuration functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or proper separation of concerns is not implemented; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code structure is not scalable for adding new pricing models.
