Make sure that the code generated is executable for demonstration purposes. Could you write a small program for my phone that can sort 40 names, which can be shared with around 40 people, then consolidate the data and provide statistics?",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the name sorting mechanism, with proper algorithm selection for efficiency (like quicksort, mergesort) and support for multiple sorting criteria (alphabetical, length, custom order). Score 0 if sorting is not implemented, 5 if only basic alphabetical sorting is available, and 10 if multiple flexible sorting options with proper complexity analysis are provided.",

Check for responsive design that works across different screen sizes. Deduct 5 points if text input fields are not mobile-optimized, and 3 points if there's no input validation.

Verify that sharing preserves data integrity and works without requiring special apps for recipients. Deduct 5 points if sharing requires manual copying, 5 points if there's no confirmation mechanism, and 3 points if privacy controls are absent. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to name sorting and statistics (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance on mobile devices (e.g., excessive animations).
