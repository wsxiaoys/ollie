Our company has 10 systems, and we now need to create a large preview page, similar to a navigation homepage, where all systems are placed together. Through accessing a domain address, with automatically filled username and password, customers can easily click to see a demonstration page. Please develop a design that is visually appealing and impressive.",

      "description": "Evaluate the layout structure for the 10 system previews. Check if it uses responsive grid design, appropriate spacing, and visual hierarchy. The layout should maintain consistency across different screen sizes. Award 10 points for a professional grid system with breakpoints for multiple devices; 5 points if only basic layout is implemented without responsiveness; 0 points if systems are placed randomly without proper structure.",

Examine if the authentication is seamless for customers while maintaining security standards. Award 10 points for secure, seamless implementation; deduct 5 points if credentials are exposed in client-side code; 0 points if authentication doesn't work.",

Each preview should give users a clear understanding of the system's purpose.

Check if it implements proper SSO functionality to prevent users from having to log in multiple times. Verify if session management and token passing between systems are handled securely.

Function modules unrelated to navigation/preview (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations that slow page loading).
