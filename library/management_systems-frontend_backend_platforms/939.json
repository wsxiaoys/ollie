Big Data Healthcare Project:\n\n## Interface Menu: API Rate Limiting Strategy\n\n### Functionality:\n**Rate Limiting Strategy Configuration**: Users can customize API rate limiting strategies through the following settings:\n- Duration Limit: Set time duration restrictions for API interface calls.\n- API Traffic Limit Count: Set call frequency limitations for API interfaces.\n- User Traffic Limit: Set call frequency limitations for each user.\n- Application Traffic Limit: Set call frequency limitations for each application.\n\n**Strategy Management**: Display all configured rate limiting strategies, supporting operations such as editing, deleting, viewing detailed information, etc.\n\n**Strategy Monitoring**: Monitor the implementation of rate limiting strategies, display records of non-compliant calls.\n\nBased on the above functional description, implement a new strategy form and data list of existing strategies using ant-design-vue 1.7.8.",

Check for proper form validation, field descriptions, tooltips, and intuitive input controls.

Look for visual indicators (charts, graphs, status indicators) showing rate limit violations. Assess whether time-series data is presented and if filtering by API/user/application is available.

Function modules unrelated to rate limiting (e.g., unnecessary user profile features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
