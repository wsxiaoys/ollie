      "title": "Is a functional floating window application correctly implemented with flet?",
      "description": "Verify whether the code creates a properly functioning floating window that can be moved around the screen. This should include a title bar, resize options if applicable, and proper window decoration settings. Score 0 if no floating window is created, 5 if a basic window is created but lacks mobility, and 10 if the floating window is fully implemented with proper window flags and styling.",

      "description": "Check whether the floating window can be dragged across the screen by the user. The implementation should include proper mouse event handling for drag operations, appropriate cursor changes during dragging, and boundary checks to prevent the window from being dragged off-screen. Deduct 3 points if dragging is implemented but unstable, 5 points if dragging is missing, and 2 points if boundary checks are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of window control buttons (minimize, maximize/restore, close) and their functionality. These controls should be visually distinct, properly positioned, and trigger the correct actions. Each missing control deducts 2 points. If the controls exist but don't function properly, deduct 5 points. Additional points should be awarded for controls that have appropriate hover effects and provide visual feedback.

      "description": "Review how the application manages window states (normal, minimized, maximized) and transitions between them. The code should maintain the window's previous size and position when restoring from a minimized or maximized state. Verify that window state changes are smooth and don't cause visual glitches. Deduct 5 points if state transitions cause visual artifacts, and 7 points if state management is entirely missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should handle these edge cases effectively, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the floating window concept (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow down the application). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no error handling or logging.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",
