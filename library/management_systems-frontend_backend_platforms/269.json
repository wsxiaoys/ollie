Be sure to ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration purposes. How can I implement a UI interface using QT that can call SolidWorks models and Ansys data? The functionality to implement is using QT to enable calls to SolidWorks and Ansys.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements the COM interface or SolidWorks API to communicate with SolidWorks models. Check for proper initialization, error handling during connection, and clean release of COM objects. Score 0 if no integration is implemented, 5 if basic model loading works but with limitations, and 10 if full model manipulation (loading, viewing, modifying) is properly implemented.",

Check if it handles different data types (FEA results, thermal analysis, etc.).

A complete implementation should include progress indicators for long operations and graceful error handling when data transfer fails.
