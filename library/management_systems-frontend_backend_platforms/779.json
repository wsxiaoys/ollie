Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Plant health prediction algorithms with visualization). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to plant protection (e.g., a built-in generic calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations slowing down critical functions). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the interface is not responsive across different screen sizes.
