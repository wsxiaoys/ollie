      "description": "Check whether the code correctly imports and initializes the Fyne framework, including proper application lifecycle management (App creation, window setup, and execution). Verify that the application entry point is properly structured with appropriate error handling. Score 0 if Fyne is not properly initialized, 5 if basic initialization exists but with flaws, and 10 if the implementation follows Fyne best practices including proper context management.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes a proper visual representation of a traditional Chinese Gold Ingot (Yuan Bao). Check if the visualization uses appropriate Fyne canvas elements (Rectangle, Circle, Text) or custom rendering. Deduct 5 points if the shape is too simplistic, 3 points if proper scaling is missing, and 5 points if the traditional gold color scheme (golden yellow with appropriate shading) is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if responsive design principles are applied to handle window resizing. Deduct 5 points if fixed positioning is used instead of layouts, 3 points if elements overlap incorrectly, and 5 points if the layout doesn't adapt to different screen sizes.

Verify that event handlers are properly registered and contain appropriate logic. Score 0 if no interaction is implemented, 5 if basic interaction exists but lacks feedback, and 10 if interactions are intuitive with visual/audio feedback and proper state management.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the Gold Ingot application (e.g., unnecessary system integrations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations causing lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or clean architecture principles are not followed; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if resource management is inefficient.
