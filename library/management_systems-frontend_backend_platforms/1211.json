Deduct 5 points if still primarily using Options API, 3 points if Composition API is used but with anti-patterns (such as reactive wrapping of already reactive objects). Check if proper component setup() patterns and <script setup> syntax is utilized where appropriate.",

Deduct 5 points if any component lacks type definitions, 3 points if type 'any' is overused, and 5 points if TypeScript configurations lack strictness. Full score requires comprehensive typing system similar to original Element Plus.",

Function modules unrelated to UI components (e.g., built-in state management) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations).

Check if components are properly decoupled and follow a consistent file structure. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no proper build configuration.
