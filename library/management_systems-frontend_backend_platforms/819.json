Check for hierarchical organization, responsive layout, and efficient state management across modules. Score 0 if modules remain completely separate, 5 if basic consolidation exists but with navigation issues, and 10 if modules are seamlessly integrated with consistent theming and cross-module data sharing.",

Check for proper use of D3.js/Chart.js/ECharts libraries, responsive resizing, interactive tooltips, and appropriate visualization types for different data (line charts for trends, pie charts for ratios, etc.). Assess whether visualizations include proper axes, legends, and animations. Score 0 if visualizations are static images, 5 if basic charts exist without interactivity, and 10 if fully interactive, responsively designed visualizations with appropriate data loading states are implemented.",

Verify implementation of specialized features like tagging users, blacklisting, heat map visualization for venue occupancy, and activity timeline views. Deduct 3 points if basic CRUD is missing, 3 points if filtering/sorting is absent, and 4 points if specialized module features (like venue heat maps or activity calendars) are not implemented.

Check for CSS variables or theming system (like styled-components or Material UI theming), proper contrast ratios for accessibility, and consistent application across components. Assess whether theme switching is smoothly implemented when navigating between modules.

Check for proper loading states, error boundaries, form validation, and defensive coding practices. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the specified requirements (e.g., unnecessary social networking features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or 3D elements).

Check for proper use of design patterns, code organization, and performance optimizations like memoization or virtualized lists for large datasets. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance optimizations are implemented for data-heavy views.
