  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code can be executed as shown. ======== ROLE ========\nYou are an experienced code specialist. Given a software development requirement description, you are asked to generate project code based on these requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code that is fully commented with simple, easy-to-understand language, without outputting anything else.\n\n======== OUTPUT RULES ========\n1. Always generate complete, runnable project code; ensure the project is fully executable\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete, do not omit any code\n3. Carefully review and check all code before final output, evaluating its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, regenerate it\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or need to use user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide simulated data\n\n======== PROJECT REQUIREMENTS ========\nPlease write code to implement a financial management system where finance personnel can enter income and expense items and generate financial reports; administrators can view all financial records and perform data analysis and statistics.",

Check if it supports multiple transaction types (income/expense), date selection, description fields, and category management. Score 0 if core financial entry logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic income/expense recording is available, and 10 if comprehensive financial transaction management with validation is fully included.",

Finance staff should only access entry and basic reports, while administrators can view all records and perform advanced analytics.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to financial management (e.g., a built-in game or social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations on financial data).
