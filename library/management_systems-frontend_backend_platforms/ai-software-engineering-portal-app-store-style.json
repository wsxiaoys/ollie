Design an AI intelligent portal for software engineering in the style of the App Store, displaying icons for various software engineering tools including requirements engineering tools, design engineering tools, software development tools, documentation generation tools, etc., covering all stages of software engineering. Please generate runnable code based on Bootstrap.",
