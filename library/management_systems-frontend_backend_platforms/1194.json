Check for proper component hierarchy, reusability patterns, and usage of Vue 3 specific features (e.g., teleport, fragments, multiple v-model). Score 0 if Vue 3 specific syntax is not used correctly, 5 if basic implementation is present but lacks optimization, 10 if implementation follows Vue 3 best practices with proper component design.",

Check if the store correctly handles user permissions and menu configurations. Deduct 5 points if the store structure doesn't follow Vuex best practices, 3 points if actions/mutations are inconsistently used. Ensure proper namespacing for menu-related store modules.
