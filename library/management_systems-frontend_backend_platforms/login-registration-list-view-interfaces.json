      "title": "Is the login interface properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the login interface includes all necessary elements: username/email field, password field with masking, remember me option, forgot password link, and submit button. Check for client-side validation of inputs (format checking, required fields). Verify that the interface handles authentication errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback. Score 0 if missing core elements, 5 if basic implementation only, 10 if fully implemented with validation and error handling.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the registration form includes all standard fields (username, email, password, confirm password), implements proper client-side validation (password strength requirements, email format validation, matching passwords), and provides clear feedback for validation errors. Check for terms of service agreement, privacy policy acknowledgment, and CAPTCHA/anti-bot measures. Deduct 3 points for each missing validation feature, 5 points if password security measures are inadequate. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the list view properly displays data with consistent formatting, includes essential features like sorting, filtering, and pagination, and handles both empty states and data loading states. Check if the list items have appropriate actions (view details, edit, delete). Deduct 3 points if pagination is missing, 3 points if sorting/filtering is absent, and 4 points if the empty/loading states aren't handled. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify the presence of navigation elements (buttons, links) in logical positions, consistent navigation patterns, and proper state management when switching views. Inspect for breadcrumbs or other orientation indicators. Deduct 3 points for each disconnected interface, 5 points for confusing navigation paths. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid input data, network issues, authentication failures) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle edge cases like form validation errors, session timeouts, and unexpected server responses. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if no exceptions are handled.",

Function modules unrelated to the core interfaces (e.g., unnecessary sidebars or widgets) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations or unnecessary API calls). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state management is poorly implemented; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no build process or dependency management is evident.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded form field, 5 points for inconsistent styling across interfaces, and 5 points for poor alignment of elements. The full score is 10 points.",
