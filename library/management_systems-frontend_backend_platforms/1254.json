Score 0 if core data fields are missing, 5 if basic structure exists but lacks proper validation, and 10 if all fields are properly structured with realistic manufacturing data patterns.",

Deduct 5 points if data lacks manufacturing context realism, 3 points if temporal logic is inconsistent.

Should include real-time status visualization and progress tracking elements. Deduct 5 points if only basic table display is implemented, 3 points if missing manufacturing-specific visual elements like progress bars or status indicators.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
