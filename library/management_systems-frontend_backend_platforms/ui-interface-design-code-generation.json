      "description": "Evaluate whether the implementation matches the provided design with pixel-perfect accuracy. Check for proper colors, spacing, fonts, and overall visual fidelity. Score 0 if the implementation looks completely different from the design, 5 if there are several noticeable inconsistencies, and 10 if it's nearly identical to the design specification.",

Check for proper heading hierarchy, alt text for images, and form label associations. Deduct 3 points for each major accessibility issue found (missing alt text, non-semantic divs for clickable elements, etc.). The full score is 10 points.",

Check for browser compatibility and if media queries are used effectively. Deduct 3 points for excessive CSS duplication, 3 points for non-responsive implementation, and 4 points for browser incompatibility issues. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations or transitions). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
