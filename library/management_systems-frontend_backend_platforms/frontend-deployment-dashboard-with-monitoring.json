Build an automated deployment dashboard that displays deployment status, version history, build logs and other information for frontend projects, with support for manually triggering builds and monitoring automated deployment workflows.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements real-time deployment status tracking through REST APIs or WebSocket connections, including pipeline stages (building, testing, deploying), progress indicators, and status change notifications. Score 0 if core status monitoring is not implemented, 5 if only basic status display is available, and 10 if comprehensive multi-stage status tracking with real-time updates is fully included.",

Requires pagination for large datasets and log streaming capabilities. Deduct 5 points if log search functionality is missing, and 3 points if version comparison features are not handled.

Must integrate with CI/CD platforms (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) with proper API error handling. Deduct 5 points if parameter validation is insufficient.

Code with strong robustness should include retry logic, graceful degradation, and proper error boundaries, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to deployment management (e.g., built-in code editor) 3. Excessive UI animations that affect dashboard performance.
