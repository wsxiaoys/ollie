I want to create a mobile app specifically for online food ordering, where customers can select menu items and place orders. Please help me generate a set of cloud-based code for this.",

      "title": "Is the core food ordering system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the essential functions of a food ordering app: menu display, item selection, cart management, and order submission. Check if it includes proper validation for required order details (items, quantities, special instructions) and handles edge cases like out-of-stock items. Score 0 if the core ordering functionality is missing, 5 if only basic item selection is implemented, and 10 if the complete ordering flow with validation is present.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the backend infrastructure uses appropriate cloud services (Firebase, AWS, Azure, etc.) with proper API endpoints for authentication, data storage, and order processing. Check if the implementation includes security measures like API keys, request validation, and data encryption. Deduct 5 points if there's no proper authentication system, and 3 points if there's no error handling for API failures. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify implementation of password hashing, session management, and account recovery options. Examine if user preferences and order history are stored securely. Deduct 5 points if authentication lacks multi-factor options or secure password policies, 3 points if profile editing is limited or missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for implementation of secure payment methods, encryption of financial data, and compliance with financial regulations. Deduct 5 points if there's no payment validation logic, 3 points if receipt generation is missing, and 5 points if financial data isn't handled according to industry standards.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Augmented reality menu visualization 4. Dietary preference filtering). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to food ordering (e.g., a built-in game while waiting) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when browsing menu). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Examine the use of appropriate design patterns for mobile development. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no CI/CD pipeline configuration.
