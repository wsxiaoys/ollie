Deduct 5 points if there's no data persistence mechanism, 3 points if student information is limited to basic fields only (missing photo/ID/contact details), and 3 points if there's no bulk import option from CSV/Excel.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to attendance tracking (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow down the roll call process). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
