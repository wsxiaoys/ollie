      "title": "Is the parking management system front-end fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the Vue code accurately implements essential parking management features: car entry/exit recording, parking space management, and payment processing. Score 0 if core functionality is missing, 5 if only basic features are implemented without proper state management, and 10 if all required features are implemented with proper Vue component structure and state management (Vuex/Pinia).",

Deduct 5 points if security mechanisms are missing (authentication/authorization), and 3 points if data validation is insufficient. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if proper ORM implementation is used (JPA/Hibernate). Deduct 5 points for missing entity relationships, and 3 points for improper constraint design. The full score is 10 points.",

Assess whether WebSocket is used for real-time updates and if the reporting includes filterable/exportable reports.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to parking management (e.g., a built-in chat system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations on critical paths). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
