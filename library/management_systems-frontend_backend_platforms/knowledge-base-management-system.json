Develop a knowledge base management system where users can upload knowledge article files (supporting md, html formats) and add categories and tags to articles; knowledge base administrators (username: knowledgemgr, password: knowpass) can log into the system, manage knowledge articles, organize them by category or tag, and set access permissions for articles.",

Check if the data models include necessary fields (title, content, author, timestamps, format type) and relationships. Score 0 if core data models are missing, 5 if basic models exist but lack key relationships, and 10 if a complete data architecture with proper relationships is implemented.",

Check if the code includes content type verification, file size limitations, and security measures against malicious uploads.

The system should support hierarchical categories, batch operations, and article filtering by categories/tags.

Function modules unrelated to knowledge base management (e.g., social networking features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
