      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a complete agent system including perception, decision-making, action execution, and learning modules. Check if the agent has proper state management, goal setting, and task execution capabilities. Score 0 if core agent logic is missing, 5 if only basic state machine is implemented, and 10 if full autonomous agent architecture with modular design is included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the monitoring dashboard includes all required components: operational status display, consciousness state visualization, planning process tracking, learning category breakdown, and progress indicators. Interface must update in real-time with WebSocket or similar technology. Deduct 5 points if any core monitoring component is missing, 3 points if real-time updates lag over 500ms. Full score requires live data streaming and interactive controls.",

Must include visual representations like flowcharts, state diagrams, or mind maps. Deduct 5 points if consciousness state is only text-based, 3 points if planning visualization lacks interactivity. Requires dynamic updates showing thought processes in real-time.",

Must include learning rate visualization, skill acquisition tracking, and performance improvement graphs. Deduct 5 points if learning is simulated rather than functional, 3 points if progress metrics are not quantifiable or visualized.",

Code with strong robustness should include error boundaries, graceful degradation, and automatic recovery. Give 10 points if fully robust, 5 points if average robustness, and 0 points if no exception handling.",

Voice narration of agent's thoughts 3. Predictive analytics of agent behavior 4. Interactive agent training controls 5. Multi-agent comparison dashboards).

Feature modules unrelated to agent monitoring (e.g., built-in games or social features) 3. Excessive visual effects that impact performance (e.g., complex 3D animations that slow down real-time updates).

Check for design patterns usage, code organization, and maintainability. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or poor separation of concerns; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate exceeds 30%; deduct 5 points if no proper error logging or debugging capabilities.
