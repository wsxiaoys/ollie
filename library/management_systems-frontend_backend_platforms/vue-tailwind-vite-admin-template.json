      "description": "Check if the project structure follows Vite best practices with proper configuration files (vite.config.js, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js). Verify that Vue 3 is correctly set up with Composition API or Options API. Tailwind CSS should be properly integrated with necessary plugins. Score 0 if core configuration is missing, 5 if basic setup exists but has configuration errors, and 10 if all configurations are optimally set with appropriate performance optimizations.",

Check for proper layout structuring with flexbox/grid. Deduct 2 points for each missing component. Award full points only if all components are responsive and properly integrated with Vue routing.",

Award 3 points for basic login UI, 3 points for proper auth state management, 4 points for comprehensive role-based protections including route guards and API authentication.

Check if these components leverage Vue's component system effectively. Award 1 point for each well-implemented component (up to 10).

Check for proper error boundaries in Vue components. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Unused utility functions/components 3. Overly complex animations that affect performance.
