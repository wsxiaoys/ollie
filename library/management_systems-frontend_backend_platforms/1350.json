      "description": "Examine whether the HTML code implements a proper SPA (Single Page Application) architecture with clear module separation (HR, Finance, Inventory, Production, etc.) and navigation framework. Check for clean component hierarchy with parent-child relationships. Score 0 if there's no clear architecture, 5 if basic module separation exists but lacks proper navigation, and 10 if the architecture follows industry standards with proper routing and state management.",

Each missing critical component costs 2 points. Deduct 5 points if key visualizations (production trend graphs, equipment utilization charts) are absent. Award full 10 points only if all core coal industry modules are present and functionally connected.",

Check whether the visualizations use appropriate chart types for different data categories (bar charts for production comparison, line charts for trends, heat maps for resource allocation). Deduct 3 points if visualizations aren't interactive, 2 points if they use inappropriate chart types, and 2 points if they lack legends or tooltips. Full score requires responsive visualizations with proper data encoding.",

      "description": "Assess whether the ERP system includes a comprehensive dashboard that aggregates critical metrics (coal extraction rates, equipment downtime, inventory levels, workforce allocation, safety incidents) for executive decision-making. The dashboard should include real-time alerts, filterable data views, and customizable displays. Deduct 5 points if the dashboard lacks data integration across departments, 3 points if it doesn't support filtering/customization, and 2 points if it lacks export functionality. Full score requires a complete executive dashboard with drill-down capabilities.",

Code with strong robustness should implement form validation, data sanitization, graceful error handling, and fallback UI states. Award 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic validation only, and 0 points if exceptions aren't managed at all.",

Function modules unrelated to coal industry ERP (e.g., built-in games or entertainment features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary 3D animations or auto-playing videos).

Check for semantic HTML usage, ARIA attributes for accessibility, proper CSS organization (preferably using CSS modules or a framework), and clean JavaScript with minimal global variables.
