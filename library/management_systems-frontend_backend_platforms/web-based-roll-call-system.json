  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration. I am currently at Harbin Preschool Teachers College. My information technology teacher has asked me to create a web-based roll call system using a computer. How should I proceed?",

      "title": "Is the roll call system core functionality fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a student database, attendance tracking mechanism, and date/time management. Check if the system can record present/absent/late statuses for each student. Score 0 if core functionality is missing, 5 if only basic attendance recording is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive attendance tracking with various statuses and timestamps is included.",

Check if student information (name, ID, profile photo, etc.) can be properly managed. Deduct 3 points if bulk import/export functionality is missing, 2 points if student search/filter is not implemented, and 3 points if data validation is inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the system properly stores attendance records (using localStorage, IndexedDB, or server-side database) and allows retrieving historical data. Verify if attendance reports can be generated and exported. Deduct 5 points if data persistence is missing, 3 points if historical data cannot be accessed easily, and 3 points if there's no reporting functionality. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the UI is designed for quick roll call in a classroom setting. Look for features like a grid/list view of students, clear visual indicators of attendance status, and quick-access buttons for marking attendance. Deduct 5 points if the interface requires too many clicks for basic operations, 3 points if status indicators are not clearly visible, and 3 points if the layout is not optimized for classroom use.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Absence notification system to parents/guardians 4. Statistical dashboard for attendance trends). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to roll call (e.g., a built-in game system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when marking attendance). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or appropriate patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code lacks comments or documentation.
