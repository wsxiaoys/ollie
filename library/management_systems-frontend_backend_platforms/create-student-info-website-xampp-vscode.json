How do I use VS Code and XAMPP panel to create a website for entering information, creating a personal information form that includes name, class, gender, age, student ID, and then store this information in a database so that teachers can access it through an IP address?",

      "description": "Check if the HTML/CSS form includes all required fields (name, class, gender, age, student ID) with proper validation attributes. Form should have clear labels, appropriate input types (text for name, number for age, radio/select for gender), and submission controls. Deduct 3 points if any field is missing, 2 points for improper input validation, and 5 points if the form lacks a proper submission mechanism. Full score is 10 points.",

Check if PHP includes proper database connection parameters and error handling. Deduct 5 points if the schema lacks proper constraints, 3 points if connection strings contain hardcoded credentials without config files, and 5 points if there's no error handling for failed connections.
