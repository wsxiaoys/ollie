  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Ensure that the code you generate is executable. Provide functionality for manual data entry of electricity consumption original data for various companies in 2022 and 2023. Data entry items include electricity consumption category, equipment code, equipment name, energy consumption amount, workload, unit consumption, electricity consumption month, and other information. Features include adding, modifying, editing, deleting, importing, and exporting electricity consumption data.\n\nBased on manually entered or imported electricity consumption data, automatically calculate the per-container energy consumption for standard containers and natural containers for equipment in the corresponding month.\n\nUpgrade the front-end from Vue 2.0 to Vue 3.0, and migrate the functionality to the Yuheng development framework. Adjust function components and styles to adapt to the new framework, and switch the usage methods of common entity classes and utility classes to ensure comprehensive adjustment and adaptation of code functionality.",
