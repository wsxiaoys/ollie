      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a secure login/registration system, including input validation, proper password hashing, session management, and CSRF protection. Score 0 if authentication is not implemented, 5 if basic login/registration exists but lacks security features, and 10 if it includes comprehensive security measures like rate limiting and multi-factor authentication options.",

Deduct 3 points if pagination is missing, 3 points if search functionality is absent, and 2 points if there are no loading states. A complete implementation should display NBA-related content in an organized manner with proper user interaction. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for API versioning, consistent response formats, and proper content-type headers. Deduct 5 points if error handling is missing, and 3 points if requests lack proper headers or payload formatting. The full score is 10 points.",

Check that each layer only communicates with adjacent layers and maintains proper encapsulation. Deduct 3 points for each instance of layer violation (e.g., Access Layer directly communicating with Business Layer). The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to NBA fan community (e.g., general sports news not specific to NBA) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or unnecessary API calls).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if responsive design principles aren't followed for different screen sizes.
