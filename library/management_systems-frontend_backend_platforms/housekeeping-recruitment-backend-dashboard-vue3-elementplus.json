Check if el-container, el-header, el-main are properly structured, and if reactive data management is implemented using ref/reactive. Score 0 if basic Vue3 syntax is incorrect, 5 if only basic layout is achieved, and 10 if all Vue3 best practices are followed with proper component composition.",

Check for el-card, el-statistic, or custom stat components with hover effects.
