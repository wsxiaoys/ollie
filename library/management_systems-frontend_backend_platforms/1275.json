Create a project with a theme of \"Ancient Chinese Natural Science Appreciation Platform,\" which should include a backend management system, login system, and content collected by crawling Baidu. The directory should be categorized using a Chinese map image style.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a complete platform structure with frontend visualization, content display, and navigation functionality. Check if the platform has clear sections for different scientific achievements categorized by periods, fields, or figures. Score 0 if only basic HTML structure exists, 5 if there's a functional but basic platform, and 10 if the platform is comprehensive with rich content organization and display features.",

Check if regions are properly mapped to content categories, with clear visual distinction, hover effects, and proper geographical accuracy. Deduct 5 points if the map is static/non-interactive, 3 points if regional divisions are inaccurate, and 3 points if content categories don't logically align with geographical regions.

Check for proper API design, database schema, and admin dashboard implementation. Deduct 5 points if content management features are missing, 3 points if there's no user role system, and 3 points if there's no content approval workflow. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should include proper error handling, input validation, and defensive programming techniques, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to ancient Chinese science (e.g., modern Western science sections) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations on educational content).

Evaluate the web crawler implementation for efficiency and respect for target site policies. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
