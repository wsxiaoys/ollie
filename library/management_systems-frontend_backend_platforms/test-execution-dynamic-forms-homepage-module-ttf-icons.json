      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the query form with proper validation, filtering logic, and state management. Check if the advanced filtering options allow for complex combinations and flexible parameter adjustments. Score 0 if query functionality is missing, 5 if only basic filtering is implemented, and 10 if it includes advanced features like fuzzy search, range filters, and parameter persistence.",

Check if the controls support conditional visibility, dependent validation, and value interpolation. Deduct 3 points if controls lack accessibility features, 3 points if validation logic is inconsistent, and 4 points if state management causes memory leaks. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that search results update reactively and maintain consistency with filter states. Deduct 5 points if the query results don't synchronize correctly with execution context, and 3 points if pagination or sorting logic has edge cases. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for responsive design implementation and information architecture.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the test system (e.g., unnecessary analytics) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.

Examine the TTF icon library implementation for consistency, proper sizing and alignment.
