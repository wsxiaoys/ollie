  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Management units can use this section to promote high-quality projects and manage financial institutions participating in investment and financing, ensuring that overall investment and financing work proceeds efficiently and orderly. Specific functions should include financial institution management information, project financing service classification, project financing information inquiry, and project financing promotion.\n\n2.2. Project Financing Service Classification\nClassify projects according to their industry, field, and other relevant information, and match different financial institutions based on these classifications. Through this classification matching, when projects need financing, they can quickly match with financial institutions that align with the project characteristics.\n\nBased on the requirements, generate a project financing service classification using Vue2+Element UI.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code accurately implements a comprehensive classification system using Vue2+Element UI. Check if it includes industry categories, sub-fields, and relevant project attributes with proper hierarchical relationships. Score 0 if no classification structure exists, 5 if only basic industry categories are implemented, and 10 if it includes a complete multi-level classification system with validation logic.",

      "description": "Review the matching algorithm that pairs projects with financial institutions based on classification criteria. The algorithm should consider multiple factors (industry preference, investment range, risk appetite) and provide weighted scoring. Deduct 5 points if matching is based on only a single attribute, 3 points if there's no optimization for match quality. The full score is 10 points for an algorithm with comprehensive criteria and ranked results.",

It should include multi-condition filtering, faceted search, and the ability to save search preferences.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
