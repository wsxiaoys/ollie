      "description": "Evaluate whether the code follows Vue.js best practices with proper component hierarchy, single-responsibility components, and proper use of props/events. Check if components are reusable and properly named. Score 0 if basic Vue syntax is incorrect, 5 if components exist but with poor organization, and 10 if components follow all best practices with proper encapsulation.",

Check if sorting, filtering, and search functionality are implemented. Score 0 if basic operations are missing, 5 if only basic listing and adding are implemented, and 10 if all operations are fully functional with validation.",

Check if state mutations follow proper patterns with actions/mutations or reactive methods. Deduct 5 points if global state is directly mutated, 3 points if reactivity issues exist.

Check if route parameters are used for book details and URL state preservation. Deduct 5 points if navigation doesn't work correctly, 3 points if route guards are missing for protected areas.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to book management (e.g., a built-in music player) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for consistent coding style, proper commenting, and use of TypeScript or PropTypes if applicable. Deduct 5 points if global component registration is overused; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not optimized.
