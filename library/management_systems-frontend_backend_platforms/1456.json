Background: A food delivery robot car project with an architecture consisting of: Frontend using uniapp vue3 js, API using Django, database using Django's built-in sqlite, service using MQTT, and ROS1. Your task is to implement functionality through MQTT, JS, ROS1, and ROS-JS that enables remote control of the robot car through a tablet mini-program using a joystick controller.",

Check for proper handling of connection states, disconnection events, and reconnection logic. The system should implement a proper publish-subscribe pattern with appropriate topic filtering.Score 0 if MQTT is not implemented, 5 if basic MQTT communication is established but lacks robust handling, and 10 if it includes comprehensive topic hierarchy design, proper QoS configuration (QoS 1 or 2 for critical controls), error handling, and connection state management.",

Check whether it captures all necessary inputs (directional movement, speed control), has proper touch/drag event handling, provides visual feedback, and handles multi-touch scenarios. Verify the controller includes proper deadzone handling and input normalization.Score 0 if the joystick is not implemented, 5 if basic joystick functionality exists but lacks precision controls or visual feedback, and 10 if the joystick includes proper event handling, visual feedback, configurable sensitivity, deadzone handling, and graceful degradation for different screen sizes.",
