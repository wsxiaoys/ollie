Score 0 if user management is missing, 5 if basic user profiles exist but lack role differentiation, and 10 if there's complete RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with proper authorization flows.",

Check if progress indicators and error handling during uploads are present. Deduct 5 points for missing image processing (resizing/compression), 3 points for lack of preview functionality, and 5 points for security vulnerabilities in file handling.

Code with strong robustness should include data validation, proper exception handling, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points if basic validation exists but edge cases aren't covered, and 0 points if exceptions crash the application.",

Function modules unrelated to team management or project tracking 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or transitions).
