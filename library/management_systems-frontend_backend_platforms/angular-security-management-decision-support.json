      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a comprehensive Angular 15 data analysis framework with proper security data models, services for data retrieval/processing, and visualization components. Check if the implementation includes data normalization techniques, risk scoring algorithms, and statistical analysis utilities for security metrics. Score 0 if core analysis capabilities are missing, 5 if basic analysis is present but lacks depth, and 10 if the framework offers comprehensive security analytics with multiple analysis methodologies.",

Verify that the system incorporates weighted decision matrices, risk-benefit analysis tools, and predictive modeling. Deduct 5 points if the recommendation engine is missing or primitive, 3 points if scenario modeling is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the code includes visualization components (charts, heatmaps, network graphs) that effectively communicate security status and risk levels. Angular components should use modern visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js, ngx-charts) with proper Angular integration through directives/components. Evaluate if visualizations are interactive, support drill-down capabilities, and offer multiple viewing options. Deduct 5 points if visualizations are static, 3 points if they lack interactivity.

Check if the implementation supports collaborative editing, approval workflows, and integration with notification systems.

Assess error handling for API failures, authentication issues, and data corruption scenarios. Code with strong robustness should provide detailed error logs, graceful degradation, and secure fallback options, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Overly complex visualizations that don't contribute to decision-making clarity. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core security analysis is obscured by unnecessary features.",

Check for unit tests with Jasmine/Karma, end-to-end tests with Protractor/Cypress, and proper TypeScript typing.
