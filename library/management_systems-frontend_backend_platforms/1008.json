      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements CRUD operations for personnel records, including employee information display, search filtering, role-based access control, and audit logging. Score 0 if the core functionality is missing, 5 if only basic operations are implemented, and 10 if comprehensive personnel management features (including performance tracking, organizational chart visualization, and approval workflows) are included.",

Check if the system implements data validation, duplicate detection, and privacy compliance measures. Deduct 3 points for missing search/filter functionality, 3 points for inadequate data validation, and 4 points for lack of customer segmentation features. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if it supports filtering by date ranges, customers, and status.

Check for visualizations like Gantt charts for production timelines and alert mechanisms for low inventory.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to management tasks (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or visualizations that slow down the interface).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
