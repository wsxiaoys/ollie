In JavaFX, when one client adds data to a table, other client pages should update in real-time to display the added data and provide voice announcements.",

      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements the TableView with appropriate columns, data binding, and cell factories. Check if the table supports proper data sorting, filtering, and pagination. Score 0 if the TableView is not implemented, 5 if basic implementation without customization, and 10 if fully featured with proper styling and user interaction handling.",

Check if it handles connection establishment, message serialization/deserialization, and reconnection logic. The implementation should include proper event listeners for data changes.

Evaluate if the implementation uses appropriate JavaFX sound libraries or external TTS engines. Voice announcements should be clear, configurable (volume/speed/voice), and not interfere with the application's performance.

Check if the server handles concurrent client connections, maintains consistent data state across clients, and implements proper authentication/authorization. Evaluate if the application uses appropriate design patterns (MVC, observer pattern). Deduct 5 points for poor concurrency handling, and 3 points for inadequate error handling during communication.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core requirements (e.g., excessive animation effects) 3. Resource-intensive features that affect performance (e.g., constant polling instead of event-based updates).
