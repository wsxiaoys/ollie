  "question": "You are a coding expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable and can be demonstrated. Please implement a food service menu file management system where chefs can upload new menu files (such as dish images and descriptions) through a front-end interface, and restaurant managers can review these menus. After approval, the menus will be displayed on the front-end for customers. The system should include menu category display functionality.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements a complete and user-friendly file upload interface for chefs, including file selection, preview, form validation, and progress indication. Check if it handles multiple file types (images, PDFs), supports drag-and-drop functionality, and provides clear feedback on upload status. Score 0 if upload functionality is missing, 5 if basic uploading exists but lacks validation or feedback, and 10 if the interface is comprehensive with all required features.",

Check if it includes notification mechanisms, review status tracking, and comment functionality. The system should display pending items clearly and provide sorting/filtering options. Deduct 5 points if approval workflows are incomplete, 3 points if notification systems are missing, and 2 points if there's no audit trail of decisions. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if it includes features like category filtering, sorting options, and responsive display across different screen sizes. Deduct 5 points if categories are fixed and not dynamically manageable, 3 points if category filtering is missing, and 4 points if the category display is not responsive.

Check if input validation is thorough and if the system handles edge cases like large file uploads or concurrent modifications. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these scenarios, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to restaurant menu management (e.g., a built-in social networking feature) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow down menu browsing).

Examine if the system uses appropriate design patterns for state management and data flow. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
