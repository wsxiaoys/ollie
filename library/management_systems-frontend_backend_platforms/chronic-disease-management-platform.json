  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable. Can you design a chronic disease management care platform that demonstrates real-time data analysis, primarily involving the monitoring of vital signs and medication for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia? Please display it using HTML.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements real-time monitoring displays for key vital signs (blood pressure, blood glucose, and cholesterol levels) using appropriate data visualization techniques and includes threshold alerts for abnormal values. Score 0 if the core monitoring components are missing, 5 if only basic static displays are implemented, and 10 if interactive, real-time monitoring with clinical thresholds is fully included.",

      "description": "Check whether the code includes functionality for tracking medication adherence, dosage schedules, and refill reminders for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia medications. Evaluate if it handles medication conflicts, provides dosage calculators based on vital signs, and includes medication history. Deduct 5 points if medication tracking is only basic lists, 3 points if no adherence tracking exists. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the platform includes comprehensive data analysis tools that show trends over time using appropriate charts (line graphs, bar charts, etc.) for all three conditions. Check if interactive elements allow filtering by date ranges and correlation analysis between different metrics. Deduct 5 points if visualizations are static, 3 points if trend analysis is limited to single metrics without correlation capabilities. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for goal-setting tools, progress tracking, and automated care plan recommendations based on vital sign trends. Deduct 5 points if care plans are static, 3 points if there's no ability to track progress against goals. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should implement data validation, error boundaries, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic error checks, and 0 points if no exception handling exists.",

Function modules unrelated to chronic disease management 3. Excessive animations or visual effects that affect performance and distract from critical health information. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global variables are overused or if there's no clear separation of concerns; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no data validation or sanitization.
