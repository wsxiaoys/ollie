How to use Tencent Cloud components to develop a technical operations management application/WeChat mini program that includes: 1. Daily inspections: inspection personnel upload inspection images, fill in inspection notes, and submit to reviewers for approval; 2. Operations support: operations staff report daily maintenance activities and submit to reviewers for approval; 3. Report queries: reviewers can check inspection and operations situations, including frequency and content.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code accurately implements the daily inspection workflow, including image upload, note entry, and approval mechanisms using Tencent Cloud components. Check if the code implements TCB (Tencent CloudBase) for data storage, image compression and storage in COS (Cloud Object Storage), and secure user authentication. Score 0 if the core functionality is missing, 5 if basic functionality is implemented but lacking cloud integration, and 10 if fully implemented with proper Tencent Cloud services.",

Verify that it uses Tencent Cloud Serverless functions for backend logic and proper database schema design for maintenance records. The implementation should include status tracking and notifications. Deduct 5 points if the approval workflow is incomplete, 3 points if notification mechanisms are missing.

Check if it implements Tencent Cloud's data visualization components, supports filtering by date ranges, personnel, and status. Verify if it includes statistical analysis functions and exportable reports. Deduct 5 points if filtering capabilities are limited, 3 points if visualization is inadequate, and 5 points if export functionality is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to operations management (e.g., a built-in game feature) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations on critical paths).
