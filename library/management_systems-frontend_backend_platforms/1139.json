      "title": "Is the total energy consumption statistics system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the total water, electricity, and coal consumption statistics with proper visualization and numerical displays. Check for integration of consumption data sources, calculation logic, and data refresh mechanisms. Score 0 if none implemented, 5 if partial implementation (missing one type), and 10 if all three energy types are fully implemented with accurate totals.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the code includes monthly breakdowns of water, electricity, and coal consumption by park. Check for filtering capabilities, time range selection, and proper aggregation logic. Score 0 if the breakdown is missing, 5 if only some energy types are broken down by park, and 10 if all energy types have complete monthly park-level statistics with proper data visualization.",

      "description": "Check if the code implements threshold-based monitoring and warning systems for all three energy types. Review if configurable thresholds are available, if real-time/near-real-time monitoring is supported, and if warning triggers function properly. Score 0 if monitoring systems are absent, 5 if basic monitoring exists without proper warning mechanisms, and 10 if comprehensive monitoring with configurable thresholds and proper warning systems are implemented for all energy types.",

      "description": "Review if the warning list for water consumption includes all required fields (affiliation, warning time, location points, warning content), supports sorting/filtering, and integrates with the monitoring system. Check if warning details can be viewed and if the system allows for acknowledgment/resolution of warnings. Score 0 if the list is missing, 5 if a basic list exists but lacks required fields or functionality, and 10 if the complete warning list with all functionality is implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as data loading failures, invalid data formats, user input errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to energy statistics (e.g., unnecessary system settings) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., complex animations in data visualization). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
