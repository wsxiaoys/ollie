      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements essential diary features: entry creation, editing, deletion, and viewing. Check if date-based organization is implemented, and if entries can store mood and thought data separately. Score 0 if basic CRUD operations are missing, 5 if basic operations exist but lack organization features, and 10 if all core diary functions are completely implemented with proper data validation.",

Check if the component hierarchy makes sense and if Vuetify's grid system is used for responsive layouts. Deduct 3 points if Vuetify's theming is not utilized, 5 points if components are used incorrectly or inconsistently, and 5 points if the responsive design is broken.

Verify if Electron or similar technology is used for Windows desktop integration. Deduct 5 points if there's no way to save data locally, 5 points if Windows-native features are absent, and 3 points if the app doesn't follow Windows design guidelines.

Check if mood data is properly stored and can be filtered/searched.

Function modules unrelated to diary keeping (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the application).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or Vue composition API/Options API is used inconsistently; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no build configuration for Windows packaging (using electron-builder or similar).
