      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a flavor classification system using appropriate data structures (arrays/objects/classes), capable of analyzing input requirements and mapping them to potential ingredients. Score 0 if there's no systematic flavor categorization, 5 if there's basic classification but without nuanced relationships, and 10 if the system includes comprehensive flavor profiles with appropriate relationships (sweet/sour/umami/bitter/salty) and intensity levels.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes a compatibility matrix between ingredients that handles complementary and contrasting flavor interactions. Check if the system can identify which ingredients work well together and which conflict. Deduct 5 points if there's no compatibility logic, 3 points if only basic pairing is implemented without addressing conflicts. The full score is 10 points if it includes weighted compatibility scores with synergistic effects.",

      "description": "Check if the algorithm can process flavor requirements and generate appropriate proportioned formulations. The algorithm should optimize for the requested flavor profile while maintaining balance. Deduct 5 points if the algorithm only provides fixed recipes, 3 points if it doesn't adjust for ingredient intensity. Full score of 10 points requires dynamic formulation with appropriate ratios and alternative suggestions.",

Deduct 5 points for command-line only interfaces, 3 points for limited input options. Give 10 points if the interface allows for detailed flavor profiling with visual representation of the resulting flavor balance.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to flavor development (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
