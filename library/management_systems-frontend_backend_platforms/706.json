      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements sketch image upload, parsing, and UI element recognition through computer vision or machine learning algorithms. Check if it can identify common UI components (buttons, input fields, navigation bars, etc.) and extract layout information. Score 0 if no sketch processing is implemented, 5 if only basic image upload is handled, and 10 if comprehensive sketch-to-component mapping with position/size extraction is fully included.",

Check if generated frontend and backend can communicate properly through API calls. Deduct 5 points if manual intervention is required for code compilation, 3 points if API integration between frontend and backend is not automated. Give 10 points if fully automated.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to prototype generation (e.g., built-in image editing tools) 3. Overly complex AI models that don't improve accuracy significantly.
