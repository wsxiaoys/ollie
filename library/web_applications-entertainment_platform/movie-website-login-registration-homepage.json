Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. Create a movie project in my \"E:\\graduation project\\movie website system\" folder, first implementing login, registration, and homepage functionality. We'll handle the data later.

      "description": "Check if the project follows a standard structure with clear separation of concerns (frontend/backend directories, assets, components, etc.). The structure should be located in 'E:\\graduation project\\movie website system'. Verify if appropriate build tools or frameworks are initialized (like React, Vue, Angular for frontend; Node.js, Spring, Django for backend). Score 0 if there is no clear structure, 5 if basic structure exists but lacks organization, and 10 for a comprehensive, industry-standard architecture.",

Check for proper form validation (email format, password strength, required fields), secure password handling (hashing, not storing plaintext), session/token management, and user feedback mechanisms. Deduct 3 points if form validation is missing, 4 points if password security is inadequate, and 3 points if user feedback is poor. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if data placeholders are properly implemented for future integration. Deduct 3 points if the layout is incomplete, 4 points if navigation is missing or broken, and 3 points if there are no data placeholders. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if media queries are properly implemented, if flexible grid systems are used, and if touch interfaces are considered.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the movie website (e.g., unnecessary social media features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
