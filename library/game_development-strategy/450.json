Help me create a survival-style game with pixel art aesthetics that can run in a computer browser, implemented in a single HTML file. Please carefully check the code to ensure the program runs properly. I may add modification requests later.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game properly implements essential survival mechanics (health, hunger, energy systems) and if the game loop handles game state updates correctly. Check for day-night cycle implementation, resource depletion, and progressive difficulty. Score 0 if core mechanics are missing, 5 if basic systems exist but lack depth, 10 if there's a comprehensive survival system with balanced mechanics.",

      "description": "Assess the quality and consistency of pixel art visuals. Look for proper scaling (no blur), consistent pixel size ratio, appropriate color palette (limited colors for authentic retro feel), and pixelated animations. Deduct 5 points if graphics are inconsistent in style, 3 points if using non-pixel art elements, and 5 points for improper scaling. Score 10 for authentic, cohesive pixel art that enhances gameplay.",

Check for smooth movement animations and responsive controls (â‰¤100ms delay). Deduct 5 points for clunky controls, 5 points for collision detection issues, and 3 points if interactions lack visual feedback. Full score requires fluid movement and intuitive interactions.",

Look for balanced resource distribution, intuitive crafting interface, and progression system through crafted items. Score 0 if these systems are absent, 5 if basic implementation exists, and 10 if there's a comprehensive system with meaningful choices and progression.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to survival gameplay (e.g., an unnecessary minigame) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particles that slow down gameplay). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global variables are overused; deduct 5 points if the code structure is monolithic without clear separation of concerns; deduct 5 points if there are noticeable frame rate issues or memory leaks.
