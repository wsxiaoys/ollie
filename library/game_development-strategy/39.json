      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a grid-based city planning system through HTML/JavaScript, including building placement mechanics, terrain constraints, and zoning functionality (residential, commercial, industrial areas). Score 0 if core city building mechanics are missing, 5 if only basic building placement is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive city planning with zoning restrictions and adjacency bonuses is fully included.",

Evaluate if research mechanics, resource production chains, and population growth are properly simulated. Deduct 5 points if resource balancing is missing, and 3 points if technology prerequisites are not enforced. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the rebuilding system reflects authentic ancient civilization elements including appropriate building types (temples, markets, granaries, walls), historical resource constraints, and period-accurate visual design. Check if the game includes realistic construction timelines and resource requirements. Deduct 5 points if buildings lack historical context, and 3 points if the rebuilding progression feels anachronistic. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if the game can resume from saved states and handle multiple save slots. Deduct 5 points if game state serialization is not implemented, and 3 points if the save/load mechanism is unreliable. Give 10 points if fully implemented with robust state management.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to ancient civilization building (e.g., modern technology elements) 3. Overly complex animations that affect gameplay performance (e.g., excessive particle effects for construction).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or object-oriented principles are not followed; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if insufficient commenting makes the code hard to understand for other developers.
