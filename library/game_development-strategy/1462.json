      "description": "Evaluate whether the code accurately implements the basic Plants vs. Zombies gameplay mechanics with Naruto theme: plant placement, zombie movement, collision detection, sun resource collection, and wave management. Score 0 if core mechanics are missing, 5 if basic functionality exists but lacks refinement, and 10 if all mechanics are properly implemented with appropriate Naruto character adaptations.",

Each character should have unique animations, attack patterns, and special abilities that align with their representation in the Naruto series. Deduct 3 points if characters are merely reskins without unique abilities, 5 points if abilities don't match Naruto lore. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for implementation of different terrains (forests, villages, etc. from Naruto universe), day/night cycles affecting gameplay, and special events like boss battles. Deduct 5 points if difficulty doesn't scale properly, 3 points if level variety is minimal. Full score is 10 points.",

Check whether the code includes methods for generating resources, storing them, and using them to deploy defenders. There should be visual feedback and appropriate animations. Deduct 5 points if the resource economy is unbalanced, 3 points if visual feedback is inadequate. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle edge cases like interrupted animations or memory leaks, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Excessive visual effects that affect performance (e.g., particle systems that cause lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if design patterns are not used; deduct 3 points if code duplication rate is high; deduct 2 points if there's no performance optimization for mobile devices.
