      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements the basic tower defense mechanics (tower placement, enemy pathing, wave system, currency/resources). Check for collision detection between projectiles and enemies, and proper damage calculation. Score 0 if core gameplay is missing, 5 if only basic functionality exists, 10 if there's a complete, balanced gameplay system with variety of towers and enemies.",

      "description": "Verify if the implementation includes touch controls, responsive design (using viewport meta tags, media queries, flexible grid layouts), and appropriate UI scaling for mobile screens. Check for touch event handling (touchstart, touchmove, touchend) instead of only mouse events. Deduct 5 points if there's no touch support, 3 points if the layout breaks on common mobile resolutions (320px-428px width). Full score requires fully functional touch controls with proper hit areas (≥44px).",

Check for battery-efficient code (avoiding constant redraws, using object pooling). Deduct 5 points if the frame rate drops below 30fps on mid-range devices, 3 points if there's no performance monitoring. Give 10 points if the game maintains 60fps with proper resource management.",

Check for proper pause/resume functionality when the browser tab loses focus or during incoming calls. Deduct 5 points if there's no state persistence between sessions, 3 points if the game doesn't handle interruptions gracefully.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to tower defense gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Heavy visual effects that affect mobile performance (e.g., excessive particle systems).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no asset preloading or optimized resource management.

Deduct 3 points for each UI element that's too small for touch, 5 points for poor contrast that hampers outdoor visibility, and 5 points for cluttered interfaces that obscure the game field.
