Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a resource management game where **Task**: Design a resource management system in which players need to collect and manage resources to build and upgrade buildings. **Hint**: Set up resource points where players can gather or trade resources, and use these resources for construction or upgrades.\n\nInclude comments in your code so that other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements resource gathering mechanics (clicking on resource points, automatic collection over time, etc.) and resource storage/inventory system. Score 0 if resource collection is not implemented, 5 if only basic collection is implemented without variety, and 10 if the system includes multiple resource types with different collection methods and rates.",

Check if buildings have different tiers/levels and if upgrades provide tangible benefits. Deduct 5 points if buildings don't have multiple upgrade levels, and 3 points if upgrades don't affect gameplay. Give 10 points for a comprehensive system with meaningful progression.",

Evaluate whether the economy is balanced with appropriate resource values and exchange rates. Deduct 5 points if trading is one-dimensional, and 3 points if there's no price fluctuation or strategic depth. Full score for a dynamic economy with meaningful player decisions.",

Check for tutorial elements, achievement systems, or quest/mission structure. Deduct 5 points if the game lacks direction, and 3 points if progression is linear with no strategic choices.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to resource management (e.g., a built-in unrelated mini-game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle animations for simple actions).
