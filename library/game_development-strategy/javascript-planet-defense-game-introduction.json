  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. JS Planet Defense Game Introduction\n\n**Game Overview:**\n\"JS Planet Defense Game\" is a strategy defense game developed with JavaScript. Players take on the role of a defense commander in space, operating the only target to combat incoming enemies.\n\n**Gameplay:**\nIn \"JS Planet Defense Game,\" players control a single target, which is the only unit capable of attacking enemies. Players need to use the target's weapon systems and tactical abilities to precisely strike incoming enemies, preventing them from causing damage to Earth or other important objectives. As the game progresses, enemies become increasingly powerful and complex, requiring players to continuously optimize their tactics and strategies to protect their objectives.\n\n**Game Features:**\n1. **Unique Operation Experience**: The uniqueness of the game lies in the fact that players can only operate one target, requiring precise control of movement and attacks to maximize defense effectiveness.\n\n2. **Challenging Level Design**: The game features multiple challenging levels, each with numerous objectives and enemies, demanding flexible thinking and quick reaction from players.\n\n**Game Tips:**\n- **Precise Target Control**: Learn to accurately control the target's movement and attacks, leveraging the characteristics of weapon systems to maximize impact on enemies.\n\n- **Tactical Positioning**: Choose appropriate positions for your target based on enemy movement paths and attack patterns to enhance defensive effectiveness.\n\n- **Tactical Upgrades and Optimization**: Utilize resources and upgrade systems in the game to continuously enhance your target's combat capability and survivability to face increasingly complex enemy challenges.\n\nOverall, \"JS Planet Defense Game\" offers players a brand new space defense challenge through its unique operational experience and deep tactical strategy. Whether pursuing high scores or exploring new tactical layouts, players can find lasting challenges and satisfaction in the game. Please include comments in your code to help other developers understand your implementation process.",

      "title": "Is the core target control system properly implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code accurately implements target movement and attack mechanics through JavaScript. Check if the control system includes smooth movement (acceleration/deceleration), precision targeting (hit detection), and proper response to user input (mouse/keyboard). Score 0 if core controls are non-functional, 5 if basic movement and shooting are implemented but lack precision, and 10 if the control system feels responsive and precise with advanced features like aim assist or predictive targeting.",

Examine if enemies respond dynamically to player positioning. Deduct 5 points if enemies follow only linear paths, 3 points if difficulty scaling is absent, and 2 points if there's no variety in enemy types. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements a comprehensive level progression system with increasing challenges, multiple objectives, and diverse enemy configurations. Check for level parameters configuration, wave management, and event triggering mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if levels are hard-coded with no flexible configuration system, and 3 points if there's no proper game state management between levels. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for resource management, upgrade persistence between levels, and visual feedback on upgrades. Deduct 5 points if upgrades are limited to simple numerical increases without strategic choices, and 3 points if there's no visual indication of upgrades. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the space defense theme (e.g., a built-in cryptocurrency miner) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems causing frame drops).
