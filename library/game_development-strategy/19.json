      "description": "Review whether the code implements effective pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra's, etc.) or simpler movement patterns (direct pursuit, flocking). Check if enemies can navigate around obstacles and avoid getting stuck in corners. Score 0 if movement is non-functional, 5 if basic direct pursuit is implemented, and 10 if sophisticated pathfinding with obstacle avoidance is included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether enemies can detect the player through vision cones, proximity detection, or other sensory systems. Check if the detection includes different states (unaware, suspicious, alerted). Verify if line-of-sight checks are implemented to prevent enemies from seeing through walls. Deduct 3 points if detection is binary (only sees/doesn't see), and 5 points if there's no line-of-sight verification. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if enemies have different attack patterns based on distance, cooldowns for attacks, and damage calculation. Ensure the attack system includes proper player feedback (visual/audio cues when being attacked). Deduct 5 points if attacks have no cooldown management, and 3 points if there's no feedback for incoming attacks. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if state transitions are smooth and logical based on game conditions. Deduct 5 points if only basic states exist with no transition logic, and 3 points if transitions are abrupt with no blending. Give 10 points for a complete state management system.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to enemy AI (e.g., weather effects) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects for each enemy).
