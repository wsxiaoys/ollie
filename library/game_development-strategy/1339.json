      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the Gomoku board and game rules through appropriate data structures. Check for win condition detection in all directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), turn management, and valid move validation. Score 0 if the core game logic is missing, 5 if only basic movement is implemented without win detection, and 10 if all game rules are correctly implemented including edge cases.",

Check for appropriate use of webviews, commands, context menus, and configuration options. Deduct 5 points if the implementation doesn't follow VSCode extension best practices, and 3 points if it doesn't handle VSCode lifecycle events properly (activation, deactivation).

Deduct 5 points if there's no game state persistence, and 3 points if the state management architecture is inconsistent or prone to bugs. Give 10 points if the state management is robust and follows best practices.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the Gomoku game (e.g., unnecessary external dependencies) 3. Features that negatively impact VSCode performance or workflow. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core editor functions are interfered with by the game.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no proper build configuration for the VSCode extension.
