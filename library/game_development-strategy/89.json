Make sure the code you provide is executable when possible.\n\nPlease implement a strategy game using HTML and JavaScript: Multiple Factions and Diplomatic System\n\n**Task**: Design a multi-faction system where players can engage in diplomacy, form alliances or wage war with other factions. Different diplomatic strategies will influence the game's outcome.\n\n**Hint**: You can use a diplomatic relations table to manage relationships between factions and adjust AI behavior based on player decisions.\n\nPlease include comments in your code to help other developers understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements distinct factions with unique attributes (resources, strengths, territories). Check if each faction has its own AI behavior patterns and strategic tendencies. Score 0 if factions are merely cosmetic, 5 if basic faction differences exist but lack strategic depth, and 10 if factions have meaningful gameplay differences with unique mechanics.",

Check for multiple relationship states (alliance, peace, tension, war, etc.) and proper transitioning mechanisms between states. Deduct 5 points if relationships are binary (ally/enemy only), 3 points if relationship changes lack proper conditions or consequences. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if diplomatic actions are limited to basic declarations, 3 points if negotiations lack counteroffer capabilities.

The AI should consider diplomatic relationships when making strategic decisions about resource allocation, military movements, and diplomatic initiatives. Deduct 5 points if AI ignores relationships in decision-making, 3 points if AI responses are predictable or lack strategic depth.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to diplomacy or strategy (e.g., unnecessary minigames) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when forming alliances).
