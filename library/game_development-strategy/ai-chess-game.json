      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the chessboard representation, piece movement rules, and game state management. Check if all chess pieces (pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, kings) follow standard chess rules. Score 0 if the core game logic is missing, 5 if basic movement is implemented but with rule gaps, and 10 if all standard chess rules are correctly implemented including special moves (castling, en passant, promotion).",

Check if it uses appropriate techniques like minimax with alpha-beta pruning, evaluation functions, or more advanced approaches like neural networks. Score 3 for basic random move selection, 7 for a medium-difficulty AI that can anticipate a few moves ahead, and 10 for a sophisticated AI that implements multiple difficulty levels and demonstrates strategic play.",

Verify if checkmate, stalemate, and draw conditions (50-move rule, threefold repetition, insufficient material) are properly detected. Deduct 3 points if any critical chess rules are missing, 2 points if game history is not maintained, and 2 points if draw conditions are not fully implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if legal moves are visually indicated and if there's visual feedback for check, checkmate, and game end conditions.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exception handling exists, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to chess (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).
