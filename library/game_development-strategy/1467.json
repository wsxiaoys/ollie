Verify that each tile has the correct properties (type, value, image).

Check if the code avoids common pitfalls like modifying arrays during iteration or using Math.random() incorrectly. Deduct 5 points if the randomization shows patterns or biases, and 3 points if the shuffling algorithm is inefficient. The full score is 10 points.",

Check whether the layout adjusts appropriately to different screen sizes and handles edge cases (like the last row having fewer than 10 tiles). Examine if the tiles are properly aligned and spaced. Deduct 5 points if the grid layout is inconsistent or breaks on different viewport sizes, and 3 points if the alignment is visually problematic. The full score is 10 points.",

The code should either use appropriate image assets or accurately render the tiles using HTML/CSS/SVG.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to mahjong tile display (e.g., a built-in scoreboard when not needed) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations slowing down rendering).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the implementation is monolithic without separation of concerns.
