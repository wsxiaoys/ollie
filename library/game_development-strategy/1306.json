      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the core palace intrigue mechanics (character relationships, status changes, plotting actions) through clear JavaScript functions. Score 0 if core intrigue logic is missing, 5 if only basic relationship changes are implemented, 10 if comprehensive court politics mechanics including alliances, betrayals, and consequences are included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game incorporates authentic Ming Dynasty elements (correct titles, historical figures, palace structures, and political systems). Look for historical accuracy in character titles, events, and setting. Deduct 5 points if major historical inaccuracies exist, 3 points if ming-specific elements are minimal or generic. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the code implements proper state management for player actions, NPC behaviors, and game progression. Examine if the state transitions are logical and if player choices meaningfully impact outcomes. Deduct 5 points if state management is rudimentary without consequences, 3 points if game state isn't persistent across actions. Give 10 points if fully implemented with multiple branching storylines.",

Award 10 points if choices significantly alter game progression with visible consequences, 5 points if choices exist but have minimal impact, 0 points if the game is purely linear without meaningful decisions.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to palace intrigue (e.g., a built-in combat system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code structure is chaotic and difficult to follow.
