Check if the squares are correctly colored in an alternating pattern. Deduct 5 points if the grid is inconsistent, 3 points if coordinates are missing or incorrect.

Each piece should be visually distinct and follow traditional chess iconography. Deduct 2 points for each piece with significant visual issues, 5 points if pieces lack detail or are difficult to distinguish from each other.

Check if the code includes event listeners for mouse/touch interactions, proper handling of piece selection and placement, and visual feedback during moves. Deduct 5 points if pieces cannot be moved interactively, 3 points if movement lacks visual feedback or has noticeable glitches.
