Try to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a horror game: Monster AI and Escape Routes\n**Task**: Implement a monster AI system where monsters patrol randomly and track players, and players need to find safe routes to avoid capture.\n**Hint**: You can set different perception ranges and tracking algorithms for monsters, and design multiple escape routes in the scene.\n[CHAT_SEP]Please optimize the game answer above and add some comments to the code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements different AI states (idle, patrolling, alert, tracking) with smooth transitions. Check if the monsters have proper path finding algorithms, random patrol routes, and player detection mechanisms. Score 0 if there's no AI implementation, 5 if only basic movement is present, and 10 if the AI includes perception ranges, memory of player's last position, and state machine transitions.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether multiple escape routes are implemented with varying difficulty levels and strategic options (hiding spots, distractions, etc.). Check if the map design includes bottlenecks, alternative paths, and safe zones. Deduct 3 points if there's only one escape route, 5 points if the routes are too simplistic with no tactical choices, and 5 points if there's no visual indication of route options.

      "description": "Verify that monsters have multiple perception systems (sight, hearing, proximity) with appropriate ranges and detection logic. Check if environmental factors affect perception (darkness reducing sight range, noise masking player sounds). Score 0 if perception is binary (detect/not detect), 5 if only basic distance checks are implemented, and 10 if the system includes cone of vision, sound propagation, and environmental interactions.",

      "description": "Assess whether the game implements proper tension-building mechanisms like proximity indicators, audio cues, and visual effects that intensify as danger approaches. Check for chase dynamics (monster speed adjustments, cornering behaviors) and escape mechanics (hiding, breaking line of sight). Deduct 5 points if tension indicators are absent and 5 points if the chase dynamics are too simple or unfair. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as off-map movement, collision edge cases, rapid state transitions, etc.) and provide appropriate fallbacks. Check error handling for game events, animation states, and player inputs. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the horror game (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Overly complex effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems).
