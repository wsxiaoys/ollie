Pay attention to ensure that the generated code is executable for display.\n\nThe chess board is typically n×n in size. In this problem, we specify the board size as 11×11.\n• Both sides take turns placing pieces continuously. Once placed on the board, chess pieces cannot be moved or removed.\n• The red side (the letter side in the coordinate system mentioned later) goes first.\n• Since Hex has a significant first-mover advantage, we introduce the pie rule: after the first piece is placed, the opponent can choose to swap this piece for their own and place it at a position symmetrical to the original position along the diagonal of the board. First and second players are randomly determined.\n• The side that connects the opposite sides of the board with pieces of the same color wins. Please regenerate the .js code according to these rules.",

Check if the hexagonal geometry is mathematically correct with proper spacing and alignment. Score 0 if the hexagonal board is not implemented, 5 if only basic grid is shown without proper hex geometry, and 10 if the complete hexagonal board with accurate coordinates is fully implemented.",
