Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a card/board game: multiplayer battles with network synchronization.\n\n**Task**: Implement a multiplayer battle system where players can compete with other players in real-time via network, with synchronized game states.\n\n**Hint**: You can use network synchronization technology to maintain consistency of the game state and handle network latency.\n\nImplement the game and include some comments in the code to help other developers understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the battle mechanics through HTML/JavaScript, including turn management, player actions, win/loss conditions, and game rule enforcement. Check if battle state transitions are properly handled and if all game actions are validated. Score 0 if core battle logic is missing, 5 if only basic turn-based mechanics are implemented, and 10 if complete battle system with all rules and edge cases are covered.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the network synchronization uses WebSocket or similar real-time communication protocol with proper message serialization/deserialization. Check for conflict resolution mechanisms when simultaneous actions occur, and whether the system handles out-of-order message delivery. Deduct 5 points if no conflict resolution exists, 3 points if message ordering is not guaranteed. Full score requires robust synchronization with state consistency verification.",

Evaluate if the system provides smooth user experience despite network latency through techniques like input buffering or interpolation. Deduct 5 points if no latency compensation exists, 3 points if prediction accuracy is poor. Full score requires sophisticated latency handling with seamless user experience.",

Check for reconnection capabilities and spectator support. Deduct 5 points if session persistence is missing, 3 points if disconnection recovery is incomplete. Give 10 points if full session lifecycle is managed with graceful error handling.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases and maintain game integrity under stress conditions. Give 10 points for excellent error handling, 5 points for basic exception handling, and 0 points if no error handling exists.",
