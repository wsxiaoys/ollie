      "description": "Review whether the code implements effective random level generation logic through HTML/JavaScript, including proper random number generation, level layout algorithms (such as procedural generation, template-based generation, or rule-based generation), and ensures each generated level is playable and balanced. Score 0 if no random generation is implemented, 5 if only basic random placement is implemented, and 10 if a sophisticated generation algorithm with validation is fully included.",

      "description": "Check whether the implementation includes well-structured predefined level components, templates, or building blocks that can be combined randomly. Evaluate if the modular system supports scalability and variation. The system should include different types of level elements (obstacles, paths, collectibles, etc.) and rules for their combination. Deduct 5 points if modules are too simple or limited, and 3 points if combination rules are poorly defined. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to level generation (e.g., built-in music player, unnecessary animations) 3. Overly complex generation that affects performance (e.g., generating too much detail that isn't used).
