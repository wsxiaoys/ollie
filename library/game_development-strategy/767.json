      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the 15x15 or 19x19 board coordinate system through HTML/JavaScript, and whether it includes win condition detection (five consecutive stones in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions), forbidden move validation for black pieces (double-three, double-four, overline rules), and turn-based gameplay mechanics. Score 0 if the core game logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic stone placement and simple win detection are implemented, and 10 if all standard Gomoku rules including forbidden moves are fully included.",

      "description": "Check whether the game board provides clear visual feedback for stone placement, including hover effects on intersection points, clear distinction between black and white stones, and proper board grid rendering. Evaluate if the board supports both mouse click and touch interactions. Deduct 5 points if stone placement feedback is unclear, and 3 points if the board intersection detection is imprecise (stones not aligning properly with grid points). The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the game can detect and handle game-ending conditions (win, draw, resignation). Deduct 5 points if move history is not maintained, and 3 points if game state transitions are not properly managed. Give 10 points if all state management features are fully implemented including save/load game functionality.",

For AI implementation, evaluate move quality and response time. For multiplayer, check turn management and game synchronization. Deduct 5 points if AI makes obviously poor moves or if multiplayer turn switching is buggy. Give 10 points for well-implemented AI or smooth multiplayer experience.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as clicking outside the board, rapid consecutive clicks, invalid moves, browser refresh during gameplay, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should prevent illegal moves and maintain game integrity under various user interactions, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Gomoku (e.g., built-in calculator or weather widget) 3. Overly complex animations that affect game responsiveness (e.g., elaborate stone-dropping physics). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core gameplay is interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if code is poorly structured; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if variable naming is inconsistent or functions are overly complex.
