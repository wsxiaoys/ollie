Score 0 if core battle logic is missing, 5 points if only basic combat mechanics are implemented, and 10 points if the system includes advanced features like different attack types, defensive mechanisms, and battle physics.",

Score 0 if AI is non-existent, 5 points for basic AI that can perform simple actions, and 10 points for sophisticated AI with adaptive behavior, multiple strategies, and different personality types.",

Function modules unrelated to the robot war gameplay 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down gameplay). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check that comments are comprehensive and helpful.
