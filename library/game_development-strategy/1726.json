You are a teacher of Chinese as a foreign language, and you are using Deepseek to create a sentence-building game page. By providing magic instructions, Deepseek gives you the corresponding code. Please narrate this complete process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the sentence-building mechanics, including word selection, sentence formation validation, and grammar checking. Score 0 if the core game logic is missing, 5 if only basic word selection is implemented, and 10 if it includes comprehensive grammar validation with feedback for learners of Chinese as a foreign language.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the implementation includes essential pedagogical elements for teaching Chinese: character/pinyin display options, difficulty levels based on HSK standards, and contextual learning hints. Deduct 5 points if there's no progression system, 3 points if linguistic explanations are missing, and 3 points if there's no visual reinforcement of character learning.

Deduct 5 points for lack of immediate feedback, 3 points for missing visual/audio reinforcement, and 5 points if there's no progress tracking for learners. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to language learning (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when displaying characters). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
