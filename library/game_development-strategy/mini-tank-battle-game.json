Check if entity interactions (tank-bullet collisions, tank-obstacle collisions) are handled correctly. Deduct 3 points if entity design is incomplete, 5 points if interactions are buggy, and give 10 points for comprehensive implementation.",

Function modules unrelated to tank battles (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no structured organization of code files/modules.

Deduct 3 points for inconsistent visual elements, 5 points for unclear distinctions between game objects, and 5 points for hard-to-read UI.
