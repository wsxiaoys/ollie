      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the Xiangqi board system (9x10 grid with river), piece movement rules (General, Advisor, Elephant, Horse, Chariot, Cannon, Soldier), position restrictions (palace boundaries, river crossing rules), and win/lose conditions. Score 0 if core movement logic is missing, 5 if only basic piece movement is implemented, and 10 if all traditional Xiangqi rules including checkmate detection are fully implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game adopts a consistent cartoon art style: 1) Piece designs should be cute and recognizable with clear Chinese characters 2) Board should have warm, friendly colors with proper contrast 3) Visual effects should maintain cartoon aesthetics (rounded corners, soft shadows, playful animations). Deduct 3 points for inconsistent art style, 5 points for poor readability of Chinese characters on pieces, and 5 points if the overall visual lacks cartoon charm. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the game includes essential interactive features: 1) Intuitive piece selection and movement with visual highlights 2) Turn-based gameplay with clear player indicators 3) Move validation with helpful error messages 4) Game restart functionality 5) Basic game history or undo feature. Deduct 3 points for each missing core interaction, 5 points if piece movement feels clunky or confusing. Full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if the game doesn't work on mobile devices, 3 points for poor performance, and 5 points if the code lacks proper web standards. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Sound effects matching the cartoon theme 3. Victory celebrations with playful animations 4. Tutorial mode for beginners 5. Theme customization options).

Function modules unrelated to Xiangqi gaming (e.g., unrelated mini-games or social features) 3. Overly complex animations that hinder gameplay flow. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core gaming functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or proper code structure is missing; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if variable naming is unclear or inconsistent.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for clashing color combinations, and 5 points for poor Chinese character legibility. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without proper feedback, 3 points for jerky animations, and 5 points for unclear interactive elements. The full score is 10 points.",
