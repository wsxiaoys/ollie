      "title": "Is the core Solitaire game logic fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the classic Solitaire rules including proper foundation building (Ace to King in same suit), tableau movement (descending order with alternating colors), and stock/waste pile management. Score 0 if core game mechanics are missing, 5 if basic card movement is implemented but with rule errors, and 10 if all Solitaire rules are properly enforced with win condition detection.",

      "description": "Check the implementation of card dealing, flipping, and movement between different game areas (tableau, foundations, stock, and waste). Proper card flipping animation should be included, and the waste-to-stock recycling mechanism should be implemented. Deduct 5 points if cards cannot be properly moved between all required areas, 3 points if the recycling mechanism is missing, and 2 points if card flipping is not visually indicated. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes proper move validation to prevent illegal moves and an undo system that allows players to reverse their actions. Check for multiple undo levels and proper state management. Deduct 5 points if move validation is incomplete, 5 points if undo functionality is missing, and 3 points if the undo system can only revert a single move. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if game saving is not implemented, 3 points if loading saved games doesn't restore the exact state, and 2 points if scoring is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Solitaire (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
