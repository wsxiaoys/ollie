      "title": "Is the Magic Trials game core system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Examine whether the code implements the fundamental trial system through HTML/JavaScript, including different types of challenges, progression mechanics, and win/fail conditions. Score 0 if core game mechanics are missing, 5 if only basic trial completion is implemented, and 10 if there's a robust system with varied trial types, difficulty progression, and meaningful player choices.",

      "description": "Check whether the code implements a comprehensive magic skill tree with dependencies, unlock conditions, visual representation, and skill effects. Evaluate if there are different skill categories, progression paths, and meaningful choices. Score 0 if the skill tree is absent, 5 if there's only a basic linear progression, and 10 if there's a complex, branching skill system with visual feedback and meaningful player progression.",

      "description": "Review the implementation of game state tracking, including player progress, acquired skills, completed trials, and persistent data storage (localStorage or similar). Check if the game properly handles saving/loading game state. Deduct 5 points if there's no persistence between sessions, and 3 points if state transitions are buggy or incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether completing trials provides meaningful rewards in the skill tree, and if acquired skills affect trial performance in return. Check if the game maintains balance between challenge and progression. Deduct 5 points if trials and skills are disconnected systems, and 3 points if the progression feels arbitrary or unbalanced. Give 10 points if fully implemented with clear feedback loops.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid input, broken skill dependencies, user operation errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Interactive tutorials with visual guidance). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to the magic theme (e.g., unnecessary minigames) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if comments are insufficient or misleading.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",
