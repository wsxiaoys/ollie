      "description": "Check whether the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code accurately implements the hexagonal game board used in TFT, with correct grid alignment and piece placement. Verify if unit positioning logic is implemented, including bench positions and board positions. Score 0 if the hexagonal board isn't implemented, 5 if only basic positioning exists, and 10 if the complete board with proper unit dragging/positioning is fully functional.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the code includes proper representation of champions with their attributes (cost, stars, traits, abilities), and if unit upgrading mechanics (combining 3 identical units) are implemented. Check if unit stats and abilities are displayed when selected. Deduct 3 points if champions lack proper traits/synergies, 5 points if unit upgrading is missing, and 3 points if unit stats display is incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if trait thresholds and corresponding bonuses are implemented correctly and visually indicated. Score 0 if synergies aren't implemented, 5 if basic trait counting exists but without effects, and 10 if complete synergy system with visual indicators and actual gameplay effects is implemented.",

Verify if leveling up mechanics and shop odds based on player level work correctly. Deduct 3 points if gold interest isn't calculated, 5 points if shop probabilities don't change with levels, and 3 points if bench management is problematic. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to TFT core gameplay (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down unit movement). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation between game mechanics and UI rendering.
