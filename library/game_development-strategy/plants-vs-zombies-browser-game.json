      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the essential game mechanics including plant placement, zombie movement, sun collection, and combat interactions. Score 0 if core gameplay is missing, 5 if only basic elements exist, and 10 if the implementation includes multiple plant types, zombie varieties, and proper collision detection.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game includes multiple levels with increasing difficulty, different zombie waves, and a level completion system. Deduct 5 points if there's only a single level, 3 points if difficulty progression is missing. Full score requires at least 3 distinct levels with proper wave management.",

      "description": "Check if the sun collection mechanic works correctly, plants have appropriate costs, and cooldown timers function as expected. Score 0 if resource management is absent, 5 if basic sun collection exists but lacks cooldowns, and 10 if all resource aspects (sun generation, collection, plant costs, and cooldowns) are properly balanced.",

Deduct 5 points for noticeable lag with 10+ entities on screen, 3 points if the game doesn't work in at least 3 major browsers, and 5 points if animation frame handling is inefficient.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid clicking, out-of-bounds placement attempts, browser resizing, etc.) and provide friendly error handling. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Achievement system). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to PvZ gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if asset loading is not optimized. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the visual design matches the original game's aesthetic while following modern design principles: 1) Consistent art style for plants and zombies 2) Clear visual distinction between game elements 3) Readable UI elements and proper scaling across screen sizes. Deduct 3 points for inconsistent art styles, 5 points for unclear visual hierarchy, and 5 points for unresponsive layouts. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for delayed plant placement (>200ms), 3 points for jerky zombie movement, and 5 points for unresponsive sun collection. The full score is 10 points.",
