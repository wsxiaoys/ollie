  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Game Rules\n- **Choose a Gesture**: Select rock, paper, or scissors by clicking the buttons.\n- **Machine Learning Opponent**: The computer uses a recurrent neural network to predict and react to the player's moves.\n\n### Game Features\n- **AI Technology**: Neural network implemented using the `brain.js` library.\n- **Real-time Learning**: The AI learns and adapts in real-time based on the player's choices.\n\n### Game Tips\n- **Vary Your Strategy**: Frequently change your move patterns to increase the difficulty for AI prediction.\n- **Observe AI Patterns**: Pay attention to the AI's move tendencies and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n### Summary\n\"Recurrent Neural Network - Rock, Paper, Scissors\" is an interactive experience that uses neural network technology to simulate the rock, paper, scissors game. Players compete against a computer based on machine learning algorithms, predicting and making moves. This game demonstrates the application of artificial intelligence in gaming, providing a novel experience of competing against AI.",

      "description": "Check whether the code correctly implements a recurrent neural network using brain.js library. Verify that the network architecture is appropriate for sequence prediction (has memory cells, proper input/output dimensions, and appropriate activation functions). Score 0 if there's no neural network implementation, 5 if a basic neural network exists but lacks recurrent connections, and 10 if a proper RNN is implemented with appropriate parameters.",

Check for: 1) Move history tracking mechanism 2) Periodic retraining of the network with new data 3) Clear evidence that AI predictions change based on player's patterns. Deduct 5 points if learning only happens at game restart, 3 points if the learning rate is too low to notice adaptation.
