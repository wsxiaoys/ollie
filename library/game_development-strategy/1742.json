      "title": "Is the Go board (Gomoku) visual representation fully implemented?",
      "description": "Check if the code accurately creates a standard Go board with the correct dimensions (typically 19x19 or 15x15 for Gomoku), proper grid lines, and star points (hoshi). Evaluate whether the board has the traditional wooden appearance with appropriate coloring. Score 0 if the board is missing, 5 if only a basic grid is implemented, and 10 if the board has authentic visual details.",

      "title": "Are the black and white stones properly implemented?",
      "description": "Verify that both black and white stones are correctly rendered with appropriate sizing (stones should cover intersection points without obscuring adjacent lines), realistic appearance (including 3D effects or shadows), and proper contrast against the board. Deduct 3 points if stones lack visual depth, 5 points if they're poorly positioned on intersections, and 3 points if they don't match traditional Go stone aesthetics.",

      "title": "Is the stone placement interaction implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code allows users to place stones on the board through mouse clicks on intersections. Check if the code correctly handles turn-based play (alternating between black and white stones) and prevents placing stones on occupied intersections. Score 0 if no interaction exists, 5 if basic placement works but has issues, and 10 if interaction is smooth and follows Go rules.",

      "title": "Are the basic Gomoku game rules implemented?",
      "description": "Check if the code implements the win condition for Gomoku (5 stones in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game should detect winning patterns automatically and notify players. Evaluate whether the game prevents further moves after a win. Score 0 if no win detection exists, 5 if only partial detection is implemented, and 10 if all win conditions are properly handled.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as out-of-bounds clicks, rapid successive clicks, browser resizing, etc.) and provide friendly error handling. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the Go board (e.g., unrelated decorations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global variables are overused; deduct 5 points if the code lacks structure or comments; deduct 5 points if performance bottlenecks are evident (e.g., inefficient redrawing of the entire board).

Deduct 3 points for inaccurate board-to-stone proportions, 5 points for non-traditional color schemes, and 5 points for poor spacing or alignment. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for delayed feedback, 3 points for jerky animations, and 5 points for unresponsive or confusing interaction patterns. The full score is 10 points.",
