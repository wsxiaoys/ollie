Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a Treasure Hunt game.\n**Task**: Design a treasure hunt game where players need to explore and fight to find hidden treasures.\n**Hint**: Set up randomly generated treasure locations and enemies. Players need to defeat enemies and solve puzzles to obtain treasures.\nPlease include comments in your code so that other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements map generation with randomized treasure locations. Check if the player movement system works correctly with proper collision detection. Score 0 if the exploration mechanic is missing, 5 if basic movement is implemented but without proper treasure randomization, and 10 if the exploration system is complete with diverse areas and discovery mechanics.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game includes a functioning combat system where players can engage with enemies. Check if there are different enemy types, health/damage mechanics, and combat animations. Score 0 if combat is absent, 5 if only basic combat is implemented (single enemy type, simple hit mechanics), and 10 if the combat system is comprehensive (multiple enemy types, varied attacks, strategic elements).",

Score 0 if puzzles are missing, 5 if only basic puzzles exist (e.g., simple key collection), and 10 if multiple diverse puzzle types are implemented with increasing complexity.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Procedurally generated maps with seed sharing 3. Environmental interaction beyond basic movement). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to treasure hunting gameplay (e.g., an unnecessary mini-game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there are no comments or documentation as requested in the requirements.

Deduct 3 points for each misaligned UI element, 5 points for inconsistent visual style, and 5 points for poor readability or cluttered information display. The full score is 10 points.",
