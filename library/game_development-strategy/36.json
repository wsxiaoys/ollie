Make sure that the generated code is executable and demonstrable.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a points system.\n\n**Task**: Implement a points system where players can earn points by completing tasks and defeating enemies, which can be used to redeem rewards.\n\n**Hint**: Set up point earning and redemption functions, and provide various reward options.\n\nPlease add comments in the code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements multiple point earning scenarios through HTML/JavaScript, including task completion rewards, enemy defeat bonuses, and achievement unlocks. Check if point calculations are precise and if different earning rates are properly configured. Score 0 if no earning logic is implemented, 5 if only basic single-source earning exists, and 10 if multiple comprehensive earning mechanisms with proper validation are included.",

      "description": "Check whether the redemption system includes comprehensive reward categories, proper point deduction logic, and transaction validation. Evaluate if the system handles insufficient points gracefully and maintains transaction integrity. Deduct 5 points if redemption validation is missing, and 3 points if transaction rollback mechanisms are not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if data persistence survives page refreshes and browser sessions. Deduct 5 points if data is lost on refresh, and 3 points if transaction history is not properly maintained.

Deduct 5 points if balance updates are not real-time, and 3 points if transaction history lacks proper filtering/sorting. Give 10 points if all management features are fully implemented with proper user feedback.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to points system (e.g., built-in games or media players) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations on every point change). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or no design patterns are used; deduct 5 points if code comments are insufficient or unclear (less than 20% comment coverage); deduct 5 points if the code structure is poorly organized.
