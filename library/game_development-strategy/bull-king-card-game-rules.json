  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Who is the Bull King\n\n\"Who is the Bull King\" is a simple and fun card game suitable for 2-10 players. The game consists of 104 cards, each with numbers from 1 to 104, and each card features a different number of bull heads. This game has won multiple awards, including the 1994 German Players' Award and the 1996 Best Mind Game Award.\n\n## Game Rules\n\n**Dealing**: Each player receives 10 cards, with 4 cards placed face-up on the table as the initial tableau. Excess cards are discarded.\n\n**Playing**: At the beginning of each round, each player selects one card from their hand to play face-down.\n\n**Card Placement Order**: When all players have placed their cards face-down, the system automatically reveals and places the cards, starting with the card closest in value to the last card on the tableau. If cards are equally close, the smaller card is placed first.\n\n**Placement Rules**: Cards are preferentially placed in positions that don't require collecting cards, then in positions closest to the end card on the tableau, and finally in positions where the end card has a smaller value.\n\n**Card Collection**: When a player places a card that is smaller than the last card on the tableau, or when placing a card in the sixth position, they must collect all the previous cards and their played card becomes the new first card on the tableau.\n\n**Game End**: There are two ways to end the game, chosen by players: either when all cards from players' hands have been played, or when a player reaches 66 bull heads.\n\n## Card Quantities\nIf there are fewer than 10 players, reduce the deck size by 20 cards for every 4 fewer players. For 7-10 players, use cards 1-104; for 3-6 players, use cards 1-84; for 2 players, use cards 1-64.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code correctly implements the 'Who is the Bull King' game structure with proper card distribution (104 cards with bull heads) and dynamic deck sizing based on player count. Check if the code properly assigns bull head values to each card and handles the initial tableau setup with 4 face-up cards. Score 0 if the card system is missing, 5 if cards are implemented but have incorrect bull head assignments, and 10 if the full card system with proper scaling for player count is implemented correctly.",
