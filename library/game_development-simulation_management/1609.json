I want to develop a game similar to Minecraft, but simpler. Please help me develop it with the following requirements: 1. The game should be a web-based 3D game; 2. In this game, players can freely build things using cubes similar to those in Minecraft; 3. Players should be able to select colors for the cubes.",
