      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the farm simulation mechanics through HTML/JavaScript, including crop planting/growing/harvesting cycles, resource management (seeds, water, tools), and economic system (buying/selling). Score 0 if core farming mechanics are missing, 5 if only basic planting is implemented, and 10 if a complete farming ecosystem with growth stages, seasonal effects, and crop varieties is included.",

      "description": "Check whether the farm environment includes a functional grid-based field system, interactive buildings (barn, shop, house), and inventory management. Evaluate if click/drag interactions for planting and harvesting are smooth and intuitive. Deduct 5 points if the field system lacks proper coordinate mapping, and 3 points if building interactions are non-functional. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game implements a realistic time progression system with day/night cycles, seasonal changes affecting crop growth, and save/load functionality for game state persistence. Check if growth timers work accurately and if the game state can be properly serialized. Deduct 5 points if time progression is unrealistic or inconsistent, and 3 points if save/load functionality is buggy. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if there are achievement milestones, level progression, and unlockable content. Deduct 5 points if the economy is unbalanced or currency system is broken, and 3 points if progression feels unrewarding or unclear. Give 10 points if fully implemented with engaging progression mechanics.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid user inputs, rapid clicking, browser refresh, localStorage errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like negative currency, invalid crop placement, or corrupted save data, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Animal husbandry with breeding mechanics 3. Seasonal festivals with special events 4. Crop mutation system 5. Market trading with price predictions).

Function modules unrelated to farming (e.g., built-in calculator or unrelated mini-games) 3. Excessive visual effects that impact performance (e.g., constant particle systems or heavy animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core farming functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or no clear separation of concerns; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if variable naming is unclear or functions are overly complex.
