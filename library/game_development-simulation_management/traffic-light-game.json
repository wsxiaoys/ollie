  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be careful to ensure the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Help me create a traffic light game using web technologies. When opened, it shows an interface where clicking the plus button allows you to create new traffic lights, including pedestrian signals, road traffic lights, and various arrow-style traffic lights, etc. Please develop this into a playable game.",

      "title": "Is the traffic light creation system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code implements a flexible traffic light creation system. Check if users can add different types of traffic lights (standard road lights, pedestrian signals, arrow lights) through the plus button interface. Score 0 if creation functionality is missing, 5 if only one type of traffic light can be created, and 10 if multiple customizable traffic light types are implemented with proper visual differentiation.",

      "title": "Is the traffic light state management system properly implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes a proper state management system for traffic lights (red-yellow-green cycles, pedestrian wait-walk states, arrow signals). Check for timing mechanisms, state transitions, and realistic traffic light behavior. Deduct 5 points if lights don't follow real-world timing patterns, 3 points if state transitions lack animations. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the implementation includes actual game mechanics (such as scoring, challenges, timing constraints or traffic management scenarios). Verify if win/loss conditions exist and whether player actions have meaningful consequences. Score 0 if no game elements exist, 5 if basic interactivity without objectives is present, 10 if complete game mechanics with clear objectives are implemented.",

      "description": "Assess whether multiple traffic lights can coordinate with each other (e.g., intersection management, sequential timing, conflicting traffic prevention). Check if the game implements realistic traffic flow patterns. Deduct 5 points if lights operate independently without coordination, 3 points if coordination exists but with unrealistic patterns.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid clicking, adding too many lights, improper user interactions) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Vehicle/pedestrian animations responding to signals). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary particle effects or animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if event handling is poorly implemented.
