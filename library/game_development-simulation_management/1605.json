  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and expert responses. Try to ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration. I want a family dynasty simulation game with a fictional background - no fantasy, gore, or horror elements, no urgent choices, and more focus on character development. I am the new family head (16 years old and unmarried), and the family includes my mother and underage sibling (brother or sister). The game includes ancient professions like officials, scholars, warriors, doctors, merchants, farmers, etc., and distinguishes between nobles and commoners. The game mainly focuses on marriage and household drama.\n\nReply settings: Each round should update the time and character information in a main interface, with all information enclosed in separate pseudo-code blocks. Use asterisks for prompts, quotation marks for dialogue, and add emoticons for expression. Use a tree diagram to show character relationships, and ensure code blocks fit mobile display dimensions. Reply 'next month' to advance to the next month, or 'restart' to regenerate character information.",

      "description": "Review if the code accurately implements the core dynasty simulation mechanics including time progression mechanism, character age tracking, family relationships management, and social class distinctions (nobles vs commoners). Score 0 if core simulation logic is missing, 5 if only basic time and character tracking exists, and 10 if the system fully models family dynamics, social status effects, and character development across time.",
