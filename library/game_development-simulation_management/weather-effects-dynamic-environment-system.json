Try to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a Weather Effects and Dynamic Environment system.\n\n**Task**: Implement a weather effects system where different weather conditions (such as storms, dense fog) will affect character movement, vision, or abilities.\n\n**Hint**: You can simulate the impact of weather on the game by changing scene lighting, wind speed, slippery surfaces, etc.\n\nPlease include comments in your code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately creates different weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, etc.) using HTML5 Canvas or WebGL. Check if each weather type has unique visual representations. Score 0 if no weather effects are implemented, 5 if only basic effects (like simple rain) exist, and 10 if there are at least 4 distinct weather types with proper particle systems and physics.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether weather effects actually impact the environment/character in meaningful ways (slippery surfaces during rain, reduced visibility in fog, slowed movement in snow, etc.). Check if these interactions are properly calculated and applied to movement mechanics. Score 0 if no interaction exists, 5 if basic interactions are present but inconsistent, and 10 if weather comprehensively affects multiple game aspects with appropriate physics.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code implements smooth transitions between different weather states rather than abrupt changes. Check for gradual parameter modifications (opacity, intensity, particle count) and appropriate easing functions. Deduct 5 points if transitions are absent, 3 points if transitions exist but are visually jarring. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for physics-based responses and not just visual overlays. Score 0 if environment is static regardless of weather, 5 if simple responses exist, and 10 if the environment has complex, physically-accurate reactions to weather conditions.",

Code with strong robustness should maintain performance under stress and gracefully degrade on weaker devices, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Weather affecting lighting and shadows realistically 3. Interactive elements like user-controlled weather manipulation).

Function modules unrelated to weather effects (e.g., unnecessary game mechanics) 3. Excessive effects that affect performance (e.g., too many particles causing lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
