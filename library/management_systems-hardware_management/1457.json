  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be careful to ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration. I am an electrical engineer who wants to create an interface for a vacuum oven with baking/heating functionality using Kunlun Tongtai TPC1031K. The requirements are that it should be able to store records and retrieve vacuum curves and temperature curves.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements core control elements for the TPC1031K interface including temperature setting, vacuum level monitoring, and real-time status display. Score 0 if the core control functions are missing, 5 if basic controls are implemented but lack precision controls, and 10 if all essential vacuum oven functions (temperature range validation, vacuum threshold alerts, safety interlocks) are fully included.",

Verify if the code properly handles data persistence through power cycles.

Check if the visualization allows for zooming, comparison of multiple records, and export capabilities.

Code with strong robustness should implement watchdog timers and graceful degradation. If the robustness is comprehensive, give 10 points. If basic error handling exists but lacks recovery mechanisms, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to vacuum oven control (e.g., unnecessary multimedia features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down critical monitoring).
