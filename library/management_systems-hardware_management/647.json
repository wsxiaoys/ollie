Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\nDevelop an electronic device borrowing management system for company employees to borrow shared equipment such as laptops, projectors, cameras, etc. The system requires user login functionality where regular employees can view available equipment lists, submit borrowing requests (specifying time period and purpose), and return equipment. Administrators (username: admin, password: 123456) can approve borrowing requests, add or remove equipment, view borrowing history, and mark equipment status (available, borrowed, under maintenance). The system should automatically send reminders about equipment return dates and track usage rates and borrowing frequency for each type of equipment.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements secure user authentication with role-based access control (regular employees vs. administrators). Check if login validation includes input sanitation, password hashing, and session management. Score 0 if authentication is missing, 5 if basic login exists without security features, and 10 if it includes proper authentication with role separation and security measures.",

Check if the system validates borrowing dates, prevents conflicts, and handles edge cases like early returns or extensions.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
