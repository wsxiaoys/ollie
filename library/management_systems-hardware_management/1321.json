      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements a responsive web interface with directional controls (forward, backward, left, right), speed adjustment, and emergency stop functionality. Check if WebSocket/HTTP communication is correctly established for real-time control. Score 0 if basic controls are missing, 5 if only basic movement controls are implemented, and 10 if all controls including speed adjustment and emergency stop are properly implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code effectively displays real-time ultrasonic sensor data through visual indicators (gauges, numerical displays, or radar-like visualizations). Check if distance thresholds for obstacle detection are properly configured and if warning indicators are shown when obstacles are detected. Deduct 3 points if visualization is missing, 3 points if data is not updated in real-time, and 2 points if warning indicators are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify if the interface shows the current tracking status and allows toggling between manual and line-following modes.

Check for proper mapping of directional controls to motor outputs, speed control implementation, and motor protection features (overcurrent detection). Deduct 5 points if PWM control is improperly implemented, 3 points if motor protection features are missing, and 2 points if speed control is inaccurate. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should implement timeout handling, reconnection mechanisms, and sensor error detection. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if no exception handling exists.",

Function modules unrelated to car control (e.g., unnecessary animations or features) 3. Heavy frontend effects that could impact performance on mobile devices or cause latency in control.

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if proper design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the interface is not responsive across different devices.
