      "title": "Is the smart home device control system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements device management through HTML/JavaScript, including support for multiple device types (lighting, temperature control, security systems, appliances). Check if real-time device status monitoring, remote control commands, and device grouping/scene management are included. Score 0 if core device interaction is not implemented, 5 if only basic on/off control is provided, and 10 if comprehensive device ecosystem with status feedback and automation rules is fully implemented.",

      "description": "Check whether the WebSocket/MQTT implementation includes device heartbeat monitoring, command acknowledgment mechanisms, and automatic retry on communication failure. Real-time sensor data streaming and bidirectional device communication are required. Deduct 5 points if message queuing is missing, and 3 points if device offline detection is not handled properly. Evaluate integration with common IoT protocols (HTTP REST, CoAP, or simulated APIs). The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the dashboard uses modern data visualization techniques with real-time charts, device status widgets, and intuitive control panels. Check for responsive layout supporting both desktop and mobile interfaces. Require implementation of customizable dashboard layouts and widget arrangements. Deduct 5 points if data visualization is static or poorly designed, 3 points if mobile responsiveness is inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the code includes intelligent automation features such as time-based scheduling, condition-triggered scenes, and rule-based device interactions. Verify implementation of scene presets, energy management optimization, and user behavior learning capabilities. Deduct 5 points if only basic timer functions are provided, and 3 points if scene management lacks flexibility. Give 10 points if advanced automation with multiple trigger conditions and complex rule chains is fully implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as device offline scenarios, network interruption, invalid sensor readings, concurrent user operations, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should include graceful degradation, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive error handling, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Predictive maintenance alerts 4. Augmented reality device placement guide 5. Integration with weather APIs for automatic adjustments).

Function modules unrelated to smart home control (e.g., built-in games or social features) 3. Overly complex animations that impact dashboard performance (e.g., excessive particle effects on device status changes). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core smart home functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or proper state management patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if configuration is hardcoded without environment-based settings.
