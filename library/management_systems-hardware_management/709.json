How can I use Xterm.js to implement a terminal for Vue and Gin projects—connecting to a remote server and controlling it? Please provide me with complete code (as fully functional as possible).",

      "description": "Check whether the Xterm.js terminal is properly initialized in a Vue component with essential options (cursorBlink, fontSize, theme configuration). Verify event handling setup for terminal input/output. Score 0 if terminal isn't functional, 5 if basic terminal display works but lacks essential options, and 10 if the terminal is fully configured with proper lifecycle management (mounted/destroyed hooks, resize handling).",

      "description": "Evaluate the WebSocket connection implementation between Vue frontend and Gin backend, including connection establishment, message handling, and error handling. Connection must include authentication mechanism and reconnection strategy. Deduct 5 points if authentication is missing, 3 points if reconnection strategy is incomplete, and 2 points if there's no connection status indicator. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for TTY allocation, proper environment variables setting, and signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM). Deduct 5 points if process management is incomplete, 3 points if session persistence isn't implemented, and 5 points if security measures are inadequate. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like connection timeouts, unexpected terminal exits, and concurrent users, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to terminal functionality (e.g., a built-in file manager when not needed) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations in the terminal UI).

Deduct 5 points if global state management is misused; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no proper error logging system.
