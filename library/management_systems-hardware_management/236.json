      "description": "Review whether the code properly structures a Vue2 application with components that handle RTMP streaming from DJI drones. Check if the application includes the necessary video player component (like vue-video-player or flv.js) configured correctly for RTMP streams. Score 0 if the core video streaming functionality is not implemented, 5 if basic streaming is implemented but with configuration issues, and 10 if the implementation is complete with proper component architecture and stream handling.",

Check if the solution includes proper initialization of the DJI SDK, drone connection management, error handling, and permission management for Windows. Verify if the code handles SDK version compatibility (particularly for Windows 64-bit systems). Deduct 5 points if drone discovery mechanism is missing, and 3 points if error handling for connection failures is inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify if it includes configuration for an RTMP server (like Nginx with RTMP module or Node-Media-Server), proper stream key generation, and stream health monitoring. Deduct 5 points if no stream quality configuration options are provided, and 3 points if there's no mechanism to handle stream interruptions. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for Windows permission handling for camera/USB access required by DJI drones.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to drone streaming (e.g., unrelated social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect streaming performance (e.g., unnecessary video filters that increase CPU usage).
