  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable. Develop a hardware inventory warning system that automatically sends alerts when inventory quantities fall below a set threshold; users can view the alert list and handle alerts (such as restocking).",

      "title": "Is the inventory monitoring and threshold detection system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements real-time inventory quantity tracking, automatic threshold comparison logic, and multi-level warning mechanisms (critical/warning/info levels). Check if the system supports configurable thresholds for different item categories and includes bulk threshold management. Score 0 if core monitoring logic is missing, 5 if only basic threshold detection is implemented, and 10 if advanced features like predictive analytics and seasonal threshold adjustments are included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the notification system supports multiple channels (email, SMS, in-app notifications, webhook integrations) with proper message queuing and retry mechanisms. Check for alert escalation logic, notification batching to prevent spam, and customizable notification templates. Deduct 5 points if delivery confirmation is missing, 3 points if no rate limiting is implemented. Full score requires multi-channel failover and delivery tracking.",

      "description": "Check whether the system provides comprehensive alert lifecycle management including alert acknowledgment, assignment to responsible personnel, status tracking (pending/in-progress/resolved), and audit trails. Evaluate if bulk alert operations, filtering/sorting capabilities, and automated alert resolution are implemented. Deduct 5 points if no workflow automation exists, 3 points if alert history is not maintained. Full score requires advanced workflow customization and SLA tracking.",

      "description": "Assess whether the system includes robust inventory data CRUD operations, supplier integration for automated reordering, purchase order generation, and inventory forecasting capabilities. Check for data validation, concurrent update handling, and integration with external inventory systems via APIs. Deduct 5 points if no automated restocking workflow exists, 3 points if data consistency mechanisms are missing. Full score requires comprehensive supply chain integration and predictive restocking.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code handles edge cases such as negative inventory values, concurrent threshold updates, network failures during alert sending, and database connection issues. Check for proper exception handling, graceful degradation, circuit breaker patterns, and comprehensive logging. Code with strong robustness should include retry mechanisms, fallback strategies, and data recovery procedures, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exception handling exists, give 0 points.",

Mobile-responsive dashboard with offline capability 3. Integration with barcode/RFID scanning 4. Automated vendor comparison and procurement suggestions 5. Real-time inventory analytics and reporting). Add 2-3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly examine three types of redundancy: 1. Duplicate alert mechanisms or notification logic 2. Features unrelated to inventory management (e.g., built-in chat system, games) 3. Over-engineered UI components that don't add functional value (e.g., excessive animations, complex charts for simple data). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core inventory functions are compromised by unnecessary complexity.",

Deduct 5 points if tight coupling between components is found; deduct 5 points if no unit tests exist for core inventory logic; deduct 5 points if database queries are not optimized or lack proper indexing. Full score requires clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and production-ready deployment configuration.",
