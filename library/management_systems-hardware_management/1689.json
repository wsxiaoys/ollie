      "description": "Review whether the code implements a comprehensive IP address management system including adding, editing, deleting, and validating IP addresses. Check for categorization options (e.g., by department, frequency of use), search/filter functionality, and batch operations. Score 0 if no IP management exists, 5 if only basic CRUD operations are available, and 10 if advanced management features are included.",

Check if connection settings like screen resolution, color depth, audio redirection, and clipboard sharing are configurable.

Evaluate whether it includes timeout settings and secure credential handling.

Check for proper resource allocation and release when connecting/disconnecting. Deduct 5 points if simultaneous connections aren't supported, 3 points if session state isn't preserved.

Check for proper exception handling, logging, and automatic reconnection attempts. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to remote desktop management (e.g., a built-in web browser) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations in the connection interface).

Check for proper error handling, logging, and configuration management. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
