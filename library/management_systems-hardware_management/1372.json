Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. Hello, I need to create an HMI for a hydraulic baler. Please make a demo for me.

      "title": "Is the HMI interface design optimized for a 7-inch resistive touchscreen?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the interface elements are appropriately sized for finger touch (minimum 40x40px touch targets) on a resistive screen, and if the layout properly utilizes the 800x480 resolution. Button spacing should be at least 10px to prevent mis-touches common with resistive screens. Deduct 5 points if touch targets are too small, 5 points if elements extend beyond screen boundaries, and 5 points if text is illegible at normal viewing distance for industrial equipment. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the HMI includes essential hydraulic baler controls such as start/stop buttons, pressure monitoring, bale density adjustment, emergency stop function, and cycle monitoring. Score 0 if core baler functions are missing, 5 if only basic controls are implemented, and 10 if comprehensive control including safety interlocks, pressure regulation, and operational modes (automatic/manual) are included.

Verify that visualization updates at appropriate intervals (â‰¤500ms for critical parameters). Deduct 5 points if visualizations are static/non-updating, 3 points if update frequency is inadequate, and 5 points if key operational parameters are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that errors are logged with timestamps and that the system provides clear recovery instructions. Deduct 5 points if alarms lack prioritization, 3 points if visual distinction between alarm levels is poor, and 5 points if no error logging mechanism exists. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to baler operation (e.g., unnecessary entertainment features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance on limited industrial hardware (e.g., complex animations).
