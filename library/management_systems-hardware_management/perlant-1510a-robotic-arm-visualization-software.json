      "description": "Evaluate whether the 3D model of the Perlant 1510a robotic arm is correctly implemented with proper joint hierarchies, proportions, and movement limitations. Check if the model includes all necessary parts (base, links, joints, end effector) with appropriate degrees of freedom. Score 0 if no model is implemented, 5 if a basic model is present but with inaccuracies, and 10 if the model accurately represents the Perlant 1510a specifications.",

The algorithm should efficiently calculate joint angles for a given end effector position. Deduct 5 points if the IK solver has accuracy issues, 3 points if edge cases are not handled, and 5 points if performance is poor for real-time visualization. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the simulation can display movement in real-time or at adjustable speeds. Verify that the visualization shows the arm's position at each step of a planned movement sequence. Deduct 5 points if trajectory planning is basic without acceleration profiles, and 8 points if only point-to-point movement without path planning is implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for visualization feedback when commands are executed, and whether the interface allows for incremental movements and precise positioning.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to robotic arm control (e.g., unnecessary data visualization tools) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects or unrealistic lighting).
