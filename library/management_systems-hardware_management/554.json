Develop a hardware repair management system where employees can submit hardware repair requests through a frontend interface, filling in hardware name, fault description, and application time. The system should display the status of all repair requests (pending, in progress, completed). Administrators (username: repairadmin, password: repair999) can assign repair personnel and update repair status.",

The form should include input validation (required fields, character limits, date format validation).
