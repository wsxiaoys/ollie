      "description": "Evaluate whether the code correctly implements real-time facial detection, facial landmark extraction, and expression classification (at least 6 basic emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, disgusted). Score 0 if facial detection is missing, 5 if only basic detection without expression classification is implemented, and 10 if both detection and accurate multi-expression classification are fully implemented.",

      "description": "Check whether the code includes proper webcam access (with browser permissions handling), video streaming setup, frame capture at appropriate intervals (15-30 fps), and fallback mechanisms for devices without cameras. Deduct 5 points if there's no error handling for camera permission denial, 3 points if the frame rate isn't optimized, and 2 points if there's no camera availability check.

Evaluate if model size balances accuracy vs. performance (under 10MB for browser usage).

Check for real-time feedback with low latency (<200ms), smooth transitions between detected expressions, and clear confidence indicators.

Code with strong robustness should log errors, provide user feedback for issues, and implement appropriate fallbacks, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
