      "description": "Review whether the code implements comprehensive multi-factor analysis, including at minimum: momentum factors, value factors, sentiment analysis, and on-chain metrics. Score 0 if no factors are implemented, 5 if only basic factors (like simple moving averages) are used, and 10 if the model incorporates at least 4 distinct factor categories with proper normalization and weighting mechanisms.",

Verify that the indicators are properly parameterized and that signal conflicts are resolved through a clear decision framework. Deduct 2 points for each missing core indicator, and 3 points if there's no signal aggregation logic.",

      "description": "Check if the system includes stop-loss mechanisms, volatility-based position sizing, drawdown controls, and market regime detection. The code must implement at least two layers of risk control (trade level and portfolio level) with clear risk metrics calculation (VaR, maximum drawdown). Deduct 5 points if there's no volatility adjustment logic, and 3 points if maximum loss limits aren't enforced. Full score requires all these elements plus backtesting of the risk controls.",

Check for implementation of Kelly criterion or similar mathematical position sizing, diversification logic across multiple assets, and correlation-aware allocation. Deduct 5 points if position sizing is static, 3 points if rebalancing logic is missing, and 2 points if there's no consideration for trading costs in the position calculations.",

Code with strong robustness should include retry mechanisms, data validation, exception handling for API calls, and graceful degradation in adverse conditions. If robust error handling exists across all modules, give 10 points. If error handling is inconsistent, give 5 points. If critical operations lack error handling, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to trading (e.g., unnecessary data visualization) 3. Computationally expensive operations that don't contribute to performance (e.g., excessive resampling of data). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no configuration separation from the code.
