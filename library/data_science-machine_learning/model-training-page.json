Verify if model descriptions update dynamically when a model is selected, and if dataset preview functionality is implemented.

Check if there are tooltips or guidance for optimal parameter selection. Deduct 3 points for missing validation, 2 points for lacking tooltips/guidance, and 2 points if parameter interdependencies are not handled. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to model training (e.g., a built-in chat system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations in training visualizations).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation between UI and business logic.
