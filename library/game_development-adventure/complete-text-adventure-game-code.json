      "title": "Is the text adventure game core engine fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a complete game engine including room/location system, inventory management, command parsing, and game state persistence. Check if the parser can handle natural language commands (go north, take key, use item) and includes command aliases. Score 0 if basic navigation is missing, 5 if only simple move/look commands work, and 10 if complex multi-word commands and contextual responses are fully supported.",

      "title": "Is the interactive narrative system comprehensive?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the game includes a rich story framework with branching narratives, character dialogue systems, and quest/puzzle mechanics. Check for dynamic text generation, story progression tracking, and multiple endings based on player choices. Deduct 5 points if dialogue lacks depth or character development, 3 points if puzzles are too simplistic. Full score requires complex narrative branching with meaningful consequences.",

      "title": "Is the game world architecture well-designed and scalable?",
      "description": "Assess whether the game world uses proper data structures for rooms, items, NPCs, and their relationships. Check for modular design allowing easy addition of new locations and content. Evaluate if the world state management supports complex interactions like item combinations, environmental changes, and persistent world modifications. Deduct 5 points if world data is hardcoded without extensibility, 3 points if object relationships are poorly structured.",

      "title": "Is the save/load and game progression system implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the code includes comprehensive save game functionality with multiple save slots, auto-save features, and game state serialization. Evaluate if the system can restore complex game states including inventory, world changes, story progress, and NPC states. Deduct 5 points if save system only covers basic variables, 3 points if no auto-save or crash recovery exists. Requires full state persistence for maximum score.",

      "title": "Is the code robust?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid commands, empty input, malformed save files, memory constraints, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle edge cases like circular command loops, null object references, and provide helpful hints for confused players. Give 10 points if fully robust, 5 points if average robustness, and 0 points if no exception handling exists.",

Procedural content generation 4. Multi-language support 5. Achievement/statistics system 6. Interactive help system with contextual hints). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "title": "Are there any redundant features?",
      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple command parsers coexisting) 2. Function modules unrelated to text adventure gaming (e.g., built-in calculator or unrelated mini-games) 3. Over-complicated features that detract from core gameplay (e.g., unnecessary graphics overlays in a text game). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core text adventure mechanics are interfered with by redundant code.",

      "title": "Does the code have engineering quality?",
      "description": "Review modular design (such as separating game logic/parser/data layers), code documentation, and maintainability. Check for proper class/function organization, consistent naming conventions, and separation of concerns. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or no design patterns are used; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if code lacks comments or documentation. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Does the text interface design meet professional standards?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the text presentation follows good typography principles: 1) Consistent text formatting and spacing 2) Clear visual hierarchy for different types of content (descriptions, dialogue, system messages) 3) Readable font choices and appropriate line spacing 4) Proper use of colors/styling to distinguish content types. Deduct 3 points for inconsistent formatting, 5 points for poor readability or eye strain, and 5 points for confusing visual hierarchy. Screenshots should show clean, professional text layout.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without clear feedback, 3 points for confusing command syntax, and 5 points for inconsistent interaction patterns. Screenshots should demonstrate responsive and user-friendly interface.",
