The implementation should handle different VR headsets (Oculus, HTC Vive, etc.) and gracefully degrade when VR is not available.0 points if WebVR/WebXR API is not implemented at all, 5 points if basic implementation exists but lacks device compatibility, 10 points for complete implementation with proper device detection, session management, and fallback mechanisms.",
