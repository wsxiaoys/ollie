  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Based on my design content, help me write a simple narrative game framework with a simple story. Since it will be presented through 3D web interaction, the game's interactive content includes the \"Four Elegances of the Song Dynasty\" (tea preparation, incense burning, flower arranging, and hanging paintings). These involve simple interactions. Please help me think about how to incorporate \"time travel\" into the painting. I've also designed an NPC cat.",

Check if the framework includes scene transitions, dialogue systems, and save/load functionality. Score 0 if the framework is missing, 5 if it's basic but functional, and 10 if it's comprehensive with proper encapsulation and extensibility.",
