      "title": "Is the character transition effect properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code implements a smooth transition effect for the character's disappearance. Check for fade-out animations, opacity transitions, or other visual effects that make the character disappear naturally rather than abruptly. Score 0 if no transition effect is implemented, 5 if basic disappearance is achieved, and 10 if the transition includes polished animations like dissolve, particle effects, or custom easing functions.",

      "title": "Is the scene appearance transition properly implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate the scene appearance mechanism after the character disappears. Look for proper scene loading, fade-in effects, and smooth transitions. The code should demonstrate techniques like preloading, cross-fading between scenes, or progressive reveal. Deduct 5 points if the scene appears abruptly without animation, and 3 points if the transition is basic but lacks polish. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Is the click event handling properly implemented?",
      "description": "Check if the click event is correctly captured and processed to trigger the transition. The implementation should include event listeners with proper scope, preventing event bubbling issues, and handling multiple clicks gracefully (preventing users from triggering the transition multiple times). Deduct 5 points if click handling is basic without safeguards, and 3 points if edge cases like rapid clicking aren't addressed. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Is asset preloading/management handled effectively?",
      "description": "Assess whether the code properly handles loading and management of visual assets required for both character and scene. Look for techniques like image preloading, texture atlases, or resource management systems. Code should avoid visible loading delays during the transition. Deduct 5 points if assets are loaded only when needed causing delays, and 3 points if loading indicators are missing. Give 10 points if asset management is comprehensive with loading optimization.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as missing assets, browser incompatibilities, performance issues on slower devices, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Sound effects synchronized with visual changes 3. Responsive design adaptation for different screen sizes). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant transition effects that overlap or conflict 2. Unnecessary DOM manipulations that could be handled more efficiently 3. Excessive animations that affect performance or distract from the main transition. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code lacks comments or documentation.

Deduct 3 points for each visual inconsistency, 5 points for clashing visual elements, and 5 points for poor composition that disrupts the transition effect. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for jerky animations, 3 points for frame rate drops during transitions, and 5 points for awkward timing that breaks immersion. The full score is 10 points.",
