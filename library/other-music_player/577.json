Create an online music player that allows users to search for songs and play them. The player should display song titles, artists, and album covers. It should support play, pause, previous, and next functions, and include a volume control slider.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements essential music playback controls (play, pause, previous, next) using HTML5 audio API or similar. Check if the player handles audio events properly (ended, timeupdate, loadedmetadata). Score 0 if core playback is missing, 5 if basic playback works but lacks proper event handling, and 10 if all playback functions work seamlessly with proper state management.",

      "description": "Check whether the search functionality connects to a music API (like Spotify, Last.fm, or a mock API) with proper error handling and loading states. Verify if search results display relevant information (title, artist, album) and if pagination/infinite scrolling is implemented for large result sets. Deduct 5 points if the search lacks filtering options, and 3 points if there's no feedback during search operations. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if metadata is properly fetched and displayed for the currently playing song and in search results. Verify the handling of missing metadata (e.g., using placeholders for missing album art).

Verify if the volume state persists between songs and if a mute toggle is available.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to music playback (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that impact playback).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
