How do I develop a mini-program for self-service car washing? Please provide detailed information, including the complete project deployment process and steps on the server. The backend uses PHP language with Hyperf framework, and the frontend uses Vue3 framework.",

      "description": "Review whether the Vue3 frontend code includes essential modules: user registration/login, car wash service selection, payment integration, booking/scheduling system, and service status tracking. Score 0 if core modules are missing, 5 if basic functionality exists but with limited features, and 10 if all essential user flows are fully implemented with proper state management (Pinia/Vuex).",

      "description": "Evaluate if the backend code properly implements Hyperf's coroutine-based architecture with appropriate middleware, controllers, services, and models. Check for RESTful API design patterns, proper dependency injection, and use of Hyperf's built-in features (async tasks, crontab, etc.). Deduct 5 points if missing proper authentication middleware, and 3 points if database models lack validation. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the code implements secure payment gateway integration, transaction record keeping, refund capabilities, and receipt generation. The system should include payment state machine handling various scenarios (success, failure, timeout, partial payment). Deduct 5 points if security measures (like idempotency keys) are missing, 3 points if webhook handlers for payment callbacks are incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for device management dashboards and real-time monitoring features. Deduct 5 points if hardware status polling is missing, 3 points if offline operation mode is not implemented.

Code with strong robustness should include comprehensive try-catch blocks, input validation, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points if robust error handling exists throughout, 5 points if average, and 0 points if exceptions aren't handled.",

Gamification elements to reward frequent users 3. Real-time consumption tracking with water/energy-saving tips). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to car washing (e.g., news feed) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations that slow down critical functions). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state management is chaotic; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if deployment process is manual.
