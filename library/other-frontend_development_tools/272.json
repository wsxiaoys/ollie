      "description": "Check if the code defines a clear integration pattern for AI services with frontend frameworks. Score 0 if no integration architecture is defined, 5 if basic API calls are implemented without proper state management, and 10 if a comprehensive pattern (e.g., middleware, hooks, composables) is established that handles API calls, response processing, error states and loading indicators. The integration should follow the idiomatic patterns of the chosen framework (Vue/React).",

      "description": "Evaluate if the code properly abstracts AI service connections through service layers or custom hooks/composables. The abstraction should handle authentication, rate limiting, request formatting, and response normalization. Deduct 3 points if authentication is hardcoded, 3 points if there's no error handling strategy, and 2 points if response parsing is inconsistent. The implementation should enable reusability across components. The full score is 10 points.",

For Vue, look for Pinia/Vuex integration or composable patterns; for React, check for Context API, Redux, or custom hooks. Deduct 3 points if loading states are missing, 3 points for inadequate error handling, and 4 points if no caching/memoization strategy exists. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if no AI-enhanced components exist, 5 if basic components are implemented but lack customization options, and 10 if the code includes a diverse set of polished, reusable AI components with proper documentation and examples.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core AI integration (e.g., unnecessary analytics) 3. Heavyweight dependencies that could affect performance (e.g., including full ML libraries in the frontend).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process doesn't handle AI service environment variables securely.
