You are an experienced Chinese programming E-language (yiyu) developer. Below are the generation and destruction relationships of the Five Elements: \"Five Elements Generation: Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water, Water generates Wood. Five Elements Destruction: Wood overcomes Earth, Earth overcomes Water, Water overcomes Fire, Fire overcomes Metal, Metal overcomes Wood.\" Please implement the Five Elements generation and destruction relationships in a Windows window program using E-language.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements both the Generation and Destruction relationships of the Five Elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water). Each element should have proper directional relationships with others. Score 0 if the core theory is missing, 5 if only one relationship type is implemented, and 10 if both Generation and Destruction relationships are fully represented with correct directional connections.",

The window should have proper title, size, position, and event handling. Deduct 3 points if the window lacks basic properties, 5 points if controls are poorly organized, and 7 points if the GUI doesn't display at all. The full score is 10 points.",

The Generation and Destruction paths should be visually distinct (different colors, line styles, or arrows). Deduct 5 points if elements lack visual distinction, 3 points if relationship lines are confusing, and 5 points if the visualization is static with no interactive component.

Deduct 5 points if interaction is limited to static display, 3 points if only one relationship type can be demonstrated, and 5 points if there's no visual feedback during interaction.

Function modules unrelated to the Five Elements theory (e.g., unnecessary game features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the program).
