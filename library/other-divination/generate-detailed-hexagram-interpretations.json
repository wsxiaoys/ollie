The generated hexagrams should include all 64 hexagrams, not just the eight basic ones. Each hexagram should have detailed explanatory texts and interpretations. The analysis needs to be more comprehensive, addressing the specific question being asked, providing detailed insights and definitive answers based on my requirements. Please regenerate the code accordingly.",

Each hexagram should be visually distinct with clear representation of broken and unbroken lines. Deduct 10 points if fewer than 64 hexagrams are implemented, 5 points if the visual representation is unclear or inaccurate.",

The algorithm should account for changing lines and properly transform between hexagrams. Deduct 5 points if only one method is implemented, 10 points if the transformation logic contains errors in calculating changing lines.",

The texts should be accurate to traditional I Ching sources.
