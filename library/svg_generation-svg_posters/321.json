  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you provide is executable whenever possible. I am a frontend developer, and I need to develop a customizable recruitment poster application where users can design their own poster templates and export them as vector files. How can this be implemented using Vue and SVG?",

      "description": "Check whether the code effectively implements an SVG-based poster generation system that allows for dynamic customization. Score 0 if there's no SVG generation code, 5 if basic SVG elements are rendered without proper customization, and 10 if the system provides a comprehensive API for creating, modifying, and styling SVG elements in the poster context.",

Check if components are properly segregated (e.g., canvas component, toolbar component, property panel component), if they use proper prop validation, emit proper events, and if the state management is appropriate for this use case (Vuex/Pinia for complex state, component state for local concerns). Deduct 3 points for monolithic components, 3 points for prop-drilling beyond 2 levels, and 4 points if reactive data isn't properly utilized.",

      "description": "Verify if users can save, load, and manage poster templates. Check if templates are serialized in a proper format (JSON), if the system handles template versioning, and if predefined templates are available as starting points. Deduct 5 points if template saving is not implemented, 3 points if there's no way to categorize templates, and 2 points if template previews aren't generated.",

Verify if text remains editable in the exported files.

Function modules unrelated to poster design (e.g., a built-in image editor when simple crop/resize would suffice) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
