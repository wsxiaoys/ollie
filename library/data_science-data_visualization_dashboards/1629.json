      "description": "Evaluate whether the most suitable chart types are chosen based on data attributes and relationships (e.g., line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, pie charts for proportions, heatmaps for correlation). Deduct 3 points for each inappropriate chart selection that obscures rather than clarifies data insights. Award 10 points for perfect chart selection with clear rationale, 5 points for adequate but not optimal choices, 0 points if charts actively misrepresent data.",

Examine if the dashboard uses grid systems for alignment and if it implements responsive design principles. Award 10 points for excellent organization with clear visual hierarchy, 5 points if layout is functional but sub-optimal, 0 points if chaotic arrangement impedes data interpretation.",

Verify that interactions provide meaningful context changes and cross-filtering between charts.

Examine if charts render progressively and if performance degrades with increasing data volume. Deduct 3 points for each second of initial load time beyond 3 seconds, 5 points if rendering flickers during interactions. Award 10 points for seamless performance.",

Code with strong robustness should prevent dashboard crashes even with unexpected inputs.
