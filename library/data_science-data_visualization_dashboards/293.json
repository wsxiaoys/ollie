  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate, professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable when possible. I want to create a desktop BI analysis software. Could you help me generate one that can import Excel files, properly map the imported fields, and automatically generate BI analysis reports?",

      "description": "Verify that the code can handle various Excel file formats (XLS, XLSX, CSV), supports multiple sheets, and properly manages data types during import (numbers, dates, text, etc.). Check for error handling for corrupted files, large datasets, and character encoding issues. Score 0 if import is not implemented, 5 if basic import exists with limitations, and 10 if the implementation is robust with comprehensive error handling.",

Check for data cleansing capabilities, handling of missing values, and validation of mapped fields. Deduct 3 points if automatic field type detection is missing, 3 points if there's no data preview functionality, and 4 points if field relationship detection is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the analysis methods match the data types (categorical vs. numerical). Deduct 2 points for each missing core analysis function.

Check if it includes anomaly highlighting, trend identification, key metric summaries, and comparative analysis. Verify that reports can be customized and saved in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, etc.).

Check for proper exception handling, graceful degradation, and data recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should provide meaningful error messages and recovery paths, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to BI analytics (e.g., unnecessary multimedia features) 3. Resource-intensive visualizations that don't contribute to data understanding. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
