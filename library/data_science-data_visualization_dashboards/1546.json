      "description": "Evaluate whether the implementation properly combines bar and line charts in a single visualization to represent the technological data. The bars should represent one metric (e.g., key areas count) while the line should represent another (e.g., growth rate). Check if the correct HTML5 Canvas/SVG elements are used with proper rendering of both chart types. Score 0 if only one chart type is implemented, 5 if both are implemented but poorly integrated, and 10 if there's seamless integration with proper visual differentiation.",

Check that the values match exactly with the provided table (AI & Big Data: 50%, IoT: 60%, etc.). Deduct 2 points for each missing or inaccurate data point. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the scales are appropriate for the data range (0-100% for growth rates).

Code with strong robustness should validate input data, implement error handling for rendering failures, and adapt responsively to different screen sizes.
