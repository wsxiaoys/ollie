How can I visualize temperature data from a serial monitor on a web interface, using USB as the communication method?",

      "description": "Check whether the code properly implements the Web Serial API or an alternative method for USB communication. Verify that it handles connection setup, disconnection handling, and error recovery. Score 0 if no serial communication code is implemented, 5 if basic connection is established but lacks error handling, and 10 if the implementation includes proper connection management, data buffering, and error handling.",

Check for validation of reasonable temperature ranges and units conversion if needed. Score 3 if basic parsing is implemented, 7 if validation and error handling are included, and 10 if the parsing is comprehensive with support for multiple formats and robust against transmission errors.",

Score 3 for static visualization, 7 for basic real-time updates, and 10 for smooth visualization with proper time scaling and performance optimization.",

Score 0 if no history is maintained, 5 if basic history is shown but lacks interaction features, and 10 if comprehensive history management with time navigation controls is implemented.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to temperature visualization (e.g., irrelevant UI components) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down real-time updates). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there is no separation of concerns.
