Please use HTML and Chart.js to help me create a comparison table showing Shanxi Province's GDP, Shanxi Province's GDP growth rate, and the national GDP growth rate from 2010-2024 based on data compiled from the National Bureau of Statistics and Shanxi Provincial Statistical Yearbook (Note: 2023-2024 are predicted values).

Check if appropriate chart types are selected for GDP values (bar chart) and growth rates (line chart). The chart should use the mixed chart type capability of Chart.js to display both values simultaneously. Deduct 5 points if library integration is incorrect, 3 points if chart types are inappropriate for the data types, and 5 points if the mixed chart functionality isn't utilized.

The data should include Shanxi Province's GDP absolute values, Shanxi Province's GDP growth rates, and national GDP growth rates.

The visualization should also include annotations indicating predicted values for 2023-2024.
