      "description": "Evaluate whether the code uses appropriate web technologies (SVG, Canvas, or CSS) to render the bar chart. Check for proper initialization, scaling, and rendering of bars. Score 0 if no functional chart is created, 5 if basic bars are displayed but with issues, and 10 if the implementation is complete and visually correct.",

All 3 categories and their corresponding values for both Traditional Mode and Circular Mode must be visualized. Deduct 3 points for each missing or incorrectly represented data point.

The visualization should normalize these different metrics for comparison or provide clear unit indicators. Deduct 4 points if units are misrepresented, 3 points if scales are inappropriate for comparison, and 3 points if no unit indicators are provided. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the visualization clearly shows the contrast between consumption and savings. The chart should visually distinguish between the two modes (e.g., through color coding, positioning, or labels) and make the comparison intuitive. Deduct 5 points if modes are not visually differentiated, 3 points if the comparison is unclear, and 2 points if labels don't clearly indicate which mode is which. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as window resizing, different screen sizes, browser compatibility issues, etc.) and provide appropriate fallbacks. Code with strong robustness should have responsive design considerations and graceful degradation. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling and responsiveness, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if these considerations are absent.",

Fancy effects that affect performance or clarity (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core visualization is obscured by redundant elements.",

Deduct 5 points if global variables are overused or proper encapsulation is missing; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there are no comments or documentation.

Deduct 3 points for each visual clutter element, 5 points for poor color choices that hinder data interpretation, and 5 points for illegible text or improper labeling. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if there's no interactivity when it would benefit understanding, 3 points for laggy interactions, and 5 points if interactive elements aren't intuitive or accessible.
