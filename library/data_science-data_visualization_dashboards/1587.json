Verify that component structure follows Vue 3 composition API best practices, with clear separation of concerns. Score 0 if Three.js isn't integrated with Vue at all, 5 if basic integration exists but has lifecycle issues, and 10 if integration is seamless with proper reactivity.",

Check for raycasting implementation to select points, data binding between map points and information sources, and visualization of changing data. The update mechanism should handle high-frequency updates (>1 update/second) without performance degradation.

Check if the visualization adapts to different data types and ranges. Verify that transitions between data states are smooth and meaningful. Deduct 5 points if visualizations are basic or limited to text only; deduct 3 points if animations are jerky or distracting.

Function modules unrelated to the dashboard visualization (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive post-processing filters).
