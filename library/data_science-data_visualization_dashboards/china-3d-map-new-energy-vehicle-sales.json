Make sure that the code you generate is executable and can be demonstrated. Create a 3D map of China showing city outlines, where the height of each city's outline represents the sales volume of new energy vehicles in that city.",

      "description": "Examine whether the code accurately renders China's geographical boundaries with appropriate GeoJSON data, including provincial and city outlines. Check if the map projection is appropriate (preferably a conformal projection like Mercator or Albers for China). Deduct 5 points if provincial boundaries are missing, 3 points if city boundaries are inaccurate, and 5 points if the projection distorts China's shape significantly. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Verify that each city's outline is extruded in 3D space proportionally to its new energy vehicle sales data. Check if the height mapping function is appropriate (linear, logarithmic, etc.) given the potential large variance in sales volumes across cities. Deduct 5 points if the height calculation is incorrect, 3 points if there's no normalization for extreme values, and 5 points if the extrusion method creates visual artifacts.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the visualization includes clear legends explaining the height-to-sales mapping, city labels for at least major cities, and annotations that help interpret the data. Check for a color scale or height scale indicator. Deduct 3 points for missing legends, 3 points for absent city labels, and 4 points if there's no way to determine actual sales figures from the visualization. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as missing data, browser compatibility issues, mobile responsiveness, etc.) and provide graceful fallbacks or error handling. Code with strong robustness should load fallback data if the main dataset fails, handle WebGL/3D rendering limitations, and adapt to different screen sizes. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic error checks, and 0 points if errors crash the application.",

Visualization elements unrelated to the city sales data (e.g., unnecessary decorative elements) 3. Heavy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems or shaders).
