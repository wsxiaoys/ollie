      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements real-time stock data fetching and display through HTML/JavaScript, including stock price updates, percentage changes, volume data, and limit-up detection logic. Score 0 if core data display is not implemented, 5 if only basic price display is shown, and 10 if comprehensive stock metrics including limit-up alerts are fully integrated.",

Deduct 5 points if the visual style doesn't match professional trading platforms, and 3 points if color coding doesn't follow market standards. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to stock monitoring (e.g., built-in games or social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during data updates).
