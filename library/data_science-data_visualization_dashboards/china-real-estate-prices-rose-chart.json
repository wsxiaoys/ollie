      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements rose chart (polar area chart) using HTML/JavaScript/SVG, including proper polar coordinate system transformation, data binding, and sector area calculations proportional to real estate price values. Score 0 if basic chart structure is missing, 5 if only simple polar rendering is implemented, and 10 if complete rose chart with accurate data mapping and sector proportions is fully implemented.",

      "description": "Check whether the implementation includes realistic Chinese city real estate price data (at least 50+ cities), proper data validation, normalization algorithms, and handling of missing/invalid data points. Evaluate data source credibility and whether price ranges reflect realistic market conditions. Deduct 5 points if data is clearly fabricated or unrealistic, 3 points if data structure lacks proper validation. Full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if no hover interactions exist, 3 points if tooltip information is incomplete. Full score requires smooth interactive experience with comprehensive data exploration tools.",

Evaluate label positioning algorithms to avoid overlap and ensure readability. Deduct 5 points if legend is missing, 3 points if labels are overlapping or unreadable, 2 points if no data source is mentioned. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle edge cases like empty datasets or extreme price values, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to real estate data visualization (e.g., built-in games) 3. Excessive animations that affect performance (e.g., continuous particle effects). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core visualization functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points for each interaction without proper feedback, 3 points for laggy animations or slow rendering, and 5 points for unclear interaction affordances. The full score is 10 points.",
