      "title": "Is the Vue.js architecture and component system properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements Vue.js framework with proper component hierarchy, state management (Vuex/Pinia), and routing (Vue Router). Check if components are properly structured with data flow, props validation, and lifecycle management. Score 0 if basic Vue structure is missing, 5 if only basic components are implemented without state management, and 10 if complete Vue ecosystem with proper architecture is implemented.",

      "title": "Is the visitor flow data visualization comprehensively implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the system includes multiple visualization methods for visitor flow analysis such as heat maps, flow direction charts, time-series analysis, and statistical dashboards. Check if data binding is reactive and supports real-time updates. Deduct 5 points if only basic charts are provided, 3 points if interactive filtering is missing. Full score requires comprehensive multi-dimensional visualization with smooth data transitions.",

      "title": "Is the ancient city geographic mapping and spatial analysis accurately implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the code includes accurate geographic mapping of Xinzhou Ancient City with proper coordinate systems, landmark positioning, and spatial relationship analysis. Evaluate if visitor flow paths are correctly mapped to actual geographic locations with proper scaling and orientation. Deduct 5 points if geographic accuracy is poor, 3 points if spatial relationships are not properly represented. Full score requires precise geographic implementation with detailed spatial analysis.",

      "title": "Is the data processing and analysis algorithm properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the system includes proper data preprocessing, filtering, aggregation, and statistical analysis algorithms for visitor flow patterns. Check if temporal analysis, peak detection, and trend analysis are implemented. Evaluate data validation and cleansing mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if data processing is superficial, 3 points if statistical analysis is incomplete. Full score requires comprehensive data analysis with multiple algorithmic approaches.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as missing data, network interruption, invalid coordinates, empty datasets, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases and maintain system stability, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Interactive 3D visualization 4. Real-time monitoring dashboard 5. Export functionality for reports). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar visualization functions 2. Feature modules unrelated to visitor flow analysis 3. Excessive animations or effects that impact performance and distract from data analysis. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core analytical functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or Vue best practices are not followed; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate exceeds 30%; deduct 5 points if proper build configuration and optimization are missing. Full score requires excellent code structure and maintainability.",

Deduct 3 points for each poorly designed visualization element, 5 points for unprofessional color choices, and 5 points for cluttered or confusing layout.",
