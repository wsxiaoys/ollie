      "description": "Evaluate whether the code creates a comprehensive dashboard structure with proper sections for key aquaculture metrics (water quality parameters, fish growth data, feed conversion ratios, mortality rates, etc.). Score 0 if there's no dashboard structure, 5 if only a basic layout exists, and 10 if a complete, well-organized dashboard with all essential aquaculture KPIs is implemented.",

      "description": "Check if the code utilizes Chart.js to create suitable visualization types for different aquaculture metrics: line charts for time-series data (oxygen levels, temperature), bar charts for comparative data (harvest volumes, feed consumption), pie/doughnut charts for distribution data (species breakdown, cost allocation), and gauge charts for critical parameters with threshold limits. Deduct 3 points for each inappropriate chart type selection or missing essential visualization. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess if the dashboard includes functionality for real-time data updates or simulated data streams that mimic actual aquaculture monitoring systems. Check for WebSocket connections, polling mechanisms, or timer-based updates. Score 0 if no data refresh mechanism exists, 5 if basic simulation is implemented, and 10 if a comprehensive real-time monitoring system with appropriate update frequencies for different metrics is included (e.g., critical parameters updating more frequently).",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as missing data points, sensor failures, extreme outlier values) and provide appropriate fallback mechanisms or error handling. Check for data validation before visualization and graceful degradation. Code with strong robustness should handle these edge cases effectively, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Weather data integration affecting water parameters 3. Interactive pond/tank selection map 4. Cross-parameter correlation visualization). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Excessive dashboard elements unrelated to aquaculture management 3. Fancy effects that affect performance or distract from critical data (e.g., unnecessary animations on critical alerts). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core monitoring functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for proper Chart.js configuration with options appropriate for aquaculture data visualization. Deduct 5 points if global variables are excessively used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no organized structure for different dashboard sections.

Deduct 3 points for cluttered visuals, 5 points for color schemes that make data interpretation difficult, and 5 points for poor information hierarchy. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if the dashboard is unusable on mobile devices, 3 points if charts render slowly with moderate data amounts, and 5 points if critical alerts aren't immediately visible.
