  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Please help me create a comprehensive data dashboard for studying the impact of the digital economy on residential consumption in Hebei Province. It should include international internet users, registered population, and digital economy index. Output in HTML format and ensure the code is operational.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements essential visualizations (charts, graphs, tables) for digital economy metrics and residential consumption data specific to Hebei Province. Score 0 if no visualization components are implemented, 5 if only basic charts without interactivity are included, and 10 if the dashboard contains comprehensive, interactive visualizations with proper labeling and legends.",

Deduct 3 points for each missing metric. The visualization should properly contextualize these metrics in relation to residential consumption. If relationships between metrics aren't visually demonstrated, deduct 5 points. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if comparison features allow contrasting different metrics or time periods. Deduct 3 points if filtering is limited to basic options, 5 points if comparison functionality is missing, and 5 points if historical trend analysis is not possible. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if correlation plots or regression analysis visualizations are included to show relationships between digital economy and consumption.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Unnecessary decorative elements that distract from the data 3. Resource-intensive animations or effects that slow dashboard performance without analytical benefit. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core economic analysis functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
