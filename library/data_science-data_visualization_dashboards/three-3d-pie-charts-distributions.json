  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable and ready for demonstration. Based on the data in this table, please generate three 3D pie charts for me. The first one should show the age distribution, divided into categories of 20-25 years old, 26-30 years old, 31-35 years old, 36-40 years old, and over 40 years old, displaying the proportion of each category. The second one should show the gender distribution, divided into male and female, displaying the proportion of each category. The third one should show the education distribution, divided into bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctorate, displaying the proportion of each category.",

Check if proportions are calculated correctly and if the visualization reflects accurate percentages.
