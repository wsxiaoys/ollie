      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a three-dimensional warehouse model using appropriate visualization libraries (Three.js, Babylon.js, etc.). Check if the warehouse structure includes essential elements such as shelves, goods, transport paths, and loading/unloading areas. Score 0 if only a basic skeleton is implemented, 5 if warehouse components are present but not fully interactive, and 10 if the model is comprehensive with accurate scale and proportions.",

Evaluate if the data refresh rate is appropriate for a dashboard visualization (preferably under 5 seconds). Check if there's proper handling of connection errors and recovery mechanisms.

Check if components are logically separated with clear responsibilities (visualization components, data-handling components, control panels). Examine if props, emits, and state management (Vuex/Pinia) are properly used. Deduct 5 points for monolithic components, 3 points for prop drilling beyond 3 levels. The full score is 10 points.",
