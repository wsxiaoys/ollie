Check for a grid system implementation that adapts to different screen sizes. Score 0 if there's no clear structure, 5 if basic layout exists but isn't responsive, and 10 if the dashboard has a professional, responsive layout with proper component hierarchy.",

Check for diverse chart types (line charts, bar charts, maps for route tracking, etc.) appropriate for displaying relevant metrics like security incidents, delivery times, and vehicle status. Assess whether D3.js or other libraries are used effectively. Deduct 3 points for each missing essential visualization type, and 5 points if visualizations aren't interactive.

Verify if the metrics are calculated correctly and displayed prominently with proper visual hierarchy.

Function modules unrelated to armored transport industry (e.g., irrelevant visualizations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the dashboard).
