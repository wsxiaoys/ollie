Create a comprehensive data dashboard for innovative elderly care models in Shaanxi Province, including visualization design and detailed data presentation. Output should be in HTML format to ensure executability.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a complete dashboard structure with proper HTML5 semantic layout (header, main content areas, sidebar, footer) and responsive design. Check if CSS Grid/Flexbox is used for layout management and if the dashboard includes necessary navigation components. Score 0 if the basic structure is missing, 5 if only basic layout is implemented without semantic HTML, and 10 if a complete, semantic, and responsive dashboard framework is implemented.",

Charts should include proper axes, legends, tooltips, and interactive elements. Deduct 3 points if charts lack proper legends/tooltips, 5 points if visualizations are static without interactivity, and 5 points if inappropriate chart types are chosen for the data.

Verify if the map is interactive (zoom, pan, click for details) and uses appropriate geographical encoding (colors, symbols). Deduct 5 points if the map is static, 3 points if it lacks proper legends, and 5 points if geographical data is inaccurate. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for implementation of comparative charts, before/after views, or innovation impact metrics.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Feature modules unrelated to elderly care in Shaanxi (e.g., irrelevant statistics from other regions) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary 3D effects or animations).
