  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Based on the uploaded operational data, create a data platform product for mobile devices for use by company executives.\n\nThe indicators at the top of the document are the metrics that executives are particularly concerned with. The first column of the document records all data from January 1, 2025 to March 10, 2025, where \"Group,\" \"Team,\" \"Region,\" \"Market,\" and \"Platform\" are dimensional data. Among them: Region stores several countries or regional areas, Market stores the names of countries and regions, and Platform is the platform that generates business volume. Order quantity, sales amount, receipt amount, spending, new product count, active product count are all natural indicators, while average order value, ROI, receipt rate, and return rate are derived indicators calculated from natural indicators using formulas. See the formulas in each cell of the document for calculation details.\n\nFlexibly utilize the combinations of dimensions and indicators in the document to create an HTML page for a mobile commerce data platform product suitable for company executives, and integrate it into a larger HTML page for display.",

The implementation should prioritize the metrics explicitly mentioned as being of particular concern to executives.0 points if core metrics are missing, 5 points if basic metrics are displayed without proper organization, 10 points for a complete implementation with all required metrics visually highlighted for executive focus.",

The interface should enable filtering and drill-down capabilities appropriate for mobile executive use, with special attention to the hierarchical relationship between Region and Market.Deduct 2 points for each missing dimension filter. Deduct 5 points if hierarchical relationship between Region and Market is not properly implemented. Full score requires intuitive dimension navigation suitable for executive users.",
