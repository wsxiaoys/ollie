Be careful to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. How can we implement a visualization of SELinux policies? Requirements: Develop a graphical or web interface tool that allows system administrators and security engineers to intuitively manage SELinux policies.",

      "description": "Review whether the code effectively visualizes SELinux policies through a graphical interface, including correct representation of subjects (processes), objects (files, sockets, etc.), and their relationships (permissions). Score 0 if visualization is missing, 5 if only basic policy elements are shown, and 10 if the visualization includes comprehensive policy mapping with context relationships.",

Verify if it handles policy syntax validation, provides instant feedback on policy changes, and includes a mechanism to test policies before applying them. Score 0 if editing functionality is absent, 5 if basic editing without validation is present, and 10 if complete editing with validation and testing capabilities are implemented.",

Function modules unrelated to SELinux policy management (e.g., general system configuration tools) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations in a security tool).
