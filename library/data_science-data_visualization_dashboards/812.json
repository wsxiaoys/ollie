  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration purposes. Create a bar chart where the x-axis represents consumption willingness, including \"Very willing\", \"Somewhat willing\", \"Somewhat unwilling\", and \"Very unwilling\", and the y-axis represents city types, including \"First-tier cities\", \"New first-tier cities\", \"Second-tier cities\", \"Third-tier cities\", and \"Others\" (each x-coordinate corresponds to five bars).",

      "description": "Check whether the code correctly implements a bar chart with consumption willingness on the x-axis ('Very willing', 'Somewhat willing', 'Somewhat unwilling', 'Very unwilling') and city types on the y-axis ('First-tier cities', 'New first-tier cities', 'Second-tier cities', 'Third-tier cities', 'Others'). Verify that each x-coordinate has 5 bars representing different city types. Score 0 if axes are reversed or missing, 5 if partially implemented, 10 if fully and correctly implemented.",

Check if the data format allows for easy updating and scaling.
