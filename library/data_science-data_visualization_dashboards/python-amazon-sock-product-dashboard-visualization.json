  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Create a dashboard visualization using Python showing search volume, new product percentage, and review count percentage for sock products on Amazon US site based on real data.",

      "description": "Review whether the code includes proper methods for acquiring Amazon product data (web scraping, API usage, or sample dataset loading), preprocessing steps (cleaning, normalization), and data validation. Score 0 if there is no data acquisition logic, 5 if basic data loading is implemented but with minimal preprocessing, and 10 if there is a complete ETL pipeline with error handling and data validation steps.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the dashboard includes all three required metrics (search volume, new product percentage, review count percentage) with appropriate visualization types for each (e.g., line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, pie charts for percentages). Check if the visualizations have proper titles, labels, and legends. Deduct 3 points for each missing metric, 2 points for inappropriate chart selection, and 2 points for missing critical elements like legends or axes labels. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the dashboard includes interactive elements such as filters, tooltips, hover effects, drill-down capabilities, or time range selectors. Evaluate the effectiveness of these interactions for exploring the sock product data. Award 0 points for static visualizations with no interactivity, 5 points for basic hover tooltips or simple filters, and 10 points for comprehensive interactive features with smooth transitions that enhance data exploration.",

Check if insights are presented alongside visualizations through annotations, highlights, or summary text. Award 10 points for sophisticated analysis with clear insight presentation, 5 points for basic trend identification, and 0 points if no analytical components are included.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to sock product analysis (e.g., irrelevant product categories) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations or 3D effects).
