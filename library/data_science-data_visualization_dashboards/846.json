      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements a rose chart (polar area chart) using HTML/JavaScript/SVG or Canvas, with proper polar coordinate system transformation and radial data representation. Check if housing price data for 100 Chinese cities is properly mapped to angular segments and radial distances. Score 0 if basic chart structure is missing, 5 if only simple polar visualization is implemented, and 10 if complete rose chart with accurate data binding and polar geometry is fully implemented.",

Check if data validation and error handling for missing or invalid price data is included. Deduct 5 points if data structure is poorly designed, 3 points if no data validation exists.

Evaluate if smooth transitions and animations are provided during interactions. Deduct 5 points if basic hover interactions are missing, 3 points if no filtering mechanism exists.

Check if the visualization effectively communicates housing price patterns across different city tiers and regions.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to housing price analysis (e.g., built-in weather widgets) 3. Fancy effects that affect chart readability (e.g., excessive 3D transforms, distracting particle effects).
