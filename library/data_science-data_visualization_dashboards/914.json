      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements pure tone generation using Web Audio API, with precise frequency control (20Hz-20kHz range), amplitude modulation, and both continuous and pulsed tone options. Check if the code includes calibration functions for different output devices. Score 0 if tone generation is not implemented, 5 if only basic frequency generation is implemented, and 10 if full audiometric functionality (including masking capabilities) is included.",

Look for proper axis scaling, grid lines at standard testing frequencies (250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 Hz), and correct plotting of audiometric data points. Deduct 5 points if the chart lacks standard audiometric symbols, 3 points if the scales are incorrectly implemented, and 5 points if the chart doesn't update dynamically with test results.",

Evaluate if the system properly tracks and records responses, calculates thresholds, and manages test sequences.

Check for proper use of props, events, Vuex for state management, and responsive design principles. Deduct 5 points if components are tightly coupled, 3 points if state management is inconsistent, and 5 points if the architecture doesn't separate concerns between audio processing and UI rendering.",

Function modules unrelated to audiometry (e.g., unrelated visualizations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that could interfere with precise timing).
