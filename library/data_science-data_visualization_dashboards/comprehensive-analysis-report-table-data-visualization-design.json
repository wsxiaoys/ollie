Evaluate if the code handles different data formats (CSV, JSON, etc.) and performs data cleaning operations like handling missing values, outliers, and type conversions. Score 0 if no data processing is implemented, 5 if basic parsing is present but with flaws, and 10 if comprehensive data analysis including validation and error handling is implemented.",

Check whether the code leverages library capabilities effectively and uses appropriate chart types for the specific data characteristics. Deduct 3 points if inappropriate chart types are used, 5 points if visualizations are static when interactivity would be beneficial, and 2 points if there's no responsive design implementation.
