Verify data accuracy against reliable sources (Census Bureau, etc.). Score 0 if basic population trends are missing, 5 if only showing limited metrics, and 10 if offering comprehensive demographic insights with proper data attribution.",

Check if visualizations use D3.js or other libraries effectively. Deduct 3 points if only one visualization type is used, 5 points if charts are inappropriate for the data type, and 2 points if interactive elements are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Interactive elements should provide smooth transitions and clear visual feedback.
