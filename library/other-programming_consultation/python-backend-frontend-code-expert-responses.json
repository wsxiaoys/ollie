      "title": "Is the Python backend architecture properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code includes a well-structured backend framework (Flask/Django/FastAPI) with proper routing, middleware, database integration, and API endpoints. Check for implementation of authentication, session management, and data validation. Score 0 if no backend framework is used, 5 if basic routing is implemented without proper structure, and 10 if a complete MVC/MVT pattern with proper separation of concerns is implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the Python backend properly serves frontend assets and provides RESTful/GraphQL APIs. Check for proper HTTP status codes, JSON response formatting, CORS handling, and error propagation from backend to frontend. Deduct 5 points if API responses lack proper error handling, 3 points if CORS is not configured, and 2 points if HTTP status codes are inconsistent. Full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate migration scripts, data validation, transaction handling, and backup mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if no ORM is used without justification, 3 points if database connections are not properly managed, and 2 points if no data validation is implemented. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for memory management, query optimization, and scalability considerations. Deduct 5 points if no async patterns are used for I/O operations, 3 points if inefficient algorithms are used, and 2 points if PEP 8 standards are not followed. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should include try-catch blocks, input validation, logging, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points if fully implemented with comprehensive exception handling, 5 points if basic error handling exists, and 0 points if no exceptions are handled.",

Function modules unrelated to the core purpose 3. Over-engineered solutions that add unnecessary complexity. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
