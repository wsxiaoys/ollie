  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration. I am developing a WinUI3 application and need to use ffmpeg.autogen to pull RTSP streams and display the video stream on an Image control, without audio. The video delay needs to be strictly controlled, expected to be within 200ms. Please provide a detailed design solution and output the complete code for direct use.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly initializes ffmpeg.autogen libraries, sets up the RTSP connection with appropriate parameters (TCP transport preferred over UDP for stability), and includes proper error handling for stream connection failures. Check if the code includes low-latency configurations like setting 'rtsp_flags' to 'prefer_tcp' and using 'fflags' with 'nobuffer' and 'flush_packets' options. Score 0 if ffmpeg initialization is missing, 5 if basic RTSP connection works without optimizations, and 10 if all low-latency configurations are properly implemented.",

Check if the solution correctly handles I-frames vs P-frames, avoids unnecessary frame copying, and implements a proper synchronization mechanism. Deduct 5 points if frame buffering exceeds 2 frames, 3 points if frame conversion adds unnecessary overhead, and 2 points if timestamp management is improperly implemented.

Verify that the solution includes proper disposal of unmanaged resources and doesn't leak memory during frame conversions.

Check for frame timestamp comparison, queue management techniques, or adaptive frame dropping algorithms. Deduct 5 points if no latency measurement is implemented, 3 points if measurements are inaccurate, and 2 points if there's no mechanism to maintain latency targets.

Check if the solution implements connection retry logic, graceful degradation for poor network conditions, and proper cleanup on errors. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
