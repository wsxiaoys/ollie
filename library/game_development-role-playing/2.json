Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a character leveling up and skill tree system.\n\n**Task**: Implement a character leveling system where characters can level up by collecting experience points, unlock new skills or enhance attributes.\n\n**Hint**: You can use a simple experience point system and skill tree structure to manage upgrades and skill unlocking.\n\nGame, and add some comments to your code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements an experience point tracking system, level calculation, and level-up events. Check if the experience requirements for each level follow a logical progression (e.g., logarithmic or exponential growth). Verify if the code handles edge cases like max level cap and experience overflow. Score 0 if the core level system is missing, 5 if only basic leveling is implemented, and 10 if it includes animations, sound effects, and visual feedback for level-up events.",

Check if there are multiple branching paths, prerequisites for skill unlocks, and proper visualization of connections between related skills. Verify if skill nodes store proper metadata (cost, effects, requirements). Deduct 5 points if skills aren't organized in a tree/graph structure, 3 points if there are no skill dependencies/prerequisites, and 2 points if the tree doesn't visually represent relationships between skills.

Verify if the system prevents invalid operations like unlocking unavailable skills or spending more points than available. Examine if there's proper state management for locked/unlocked skills and visual indication of available/unavailable skills. Deduct 5 points if prerequisite validation is missing and 5 points if there's no proper error handling for invalid unlock attempts. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if attribute changes affect character capabilities in meaningful ways. Verify if there are attribute caps or diminishing returns implemented. Deduct 3 points if attributes don't impact gameplay/visuals, 4 points if there's no way to customize attribute distribution, and 3 points if attribute scaling is unbalanced.

Function modules unrelated to the skill tree system (e.g., an unnecessary inventory system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects on every skill hover).
