      "title": "Is the magic spell learning system properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code implements a comprehensive spell learning mechanism including spell collection, practice progression tracking, and mastery levels. Check if there's a structured spell database with properties like element type, difficulty, and effects. Score 0 if no learning system exists, 5 if only basic spell acquisition is present, and 10 if there's a complete progression system with feedback and skill advancement.",

      "title": "Is the magic casting mechanism interactive and engaging?",
      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of spell casting interactions - whether they use keyboard combinations, mouse gestures, or other creative input methods. Check if the casting mechanism includes timing elements, accuracy requirements, or combination sequences that make spellcasting challenging and engaging. Deduct 5 points if casting is limited to simple button clicks, and 3 points if there's no visual feedback during casting. Full score requires multiple interaction patterns that increase in complexity with spell power.",

      "title": "Are the magic effects visualized appropriately?",
      "description": "Assess the visual representations of spells with animations, particle effects, or transformations. Each spell should have a distinctive visual signature that relates to its element or purpose. Deduct 5 points if effects are generic across different spells, 3 points if animations are static or jarring. Award full points only if the visualization includes smooth transitions, appropriate sound effects, and visual feedback proportional to spell power.",

      "title": "Is there a task/quest system to drive player progression?",
      "description": "Check if the code implements a structured task system with clear objectives, completion criteria, and rewards. Quests should progressively introduce more complex magic concepts and require mastery of previously learned spells. Score 0 if no quest system exists, 5 if only basic tasks are present without progression logic, and 10 if there's a complete branching quest system with difficulty scaling and narrative elements.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid spell inputs, rapid-fire casting attempts, or interrupted spell sequences) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Spell customization or evolution system). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to magic learning (e.g., an overly complex character creator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance without enhancing gameplay. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there are no meaningful comments explaining magic system components.

Deduct 5 points for each spell without visual feedback, 3 points for choppy animations during complex spells, and 5 points for unintuitive spell learning interfaces. The full score is 10 points.",
