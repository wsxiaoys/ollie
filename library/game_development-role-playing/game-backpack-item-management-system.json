Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration purposes.\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a Backpack and Item Management system.\n**Task**: Implement a backpack system that allows players to collect, view, and use different items.\n**Tip**: You can use a simple list to manage items and set different effects for each item.\ngame, and include some comments in the code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Check if the HTML/CSS implementation creates a visually distinct backpack interface with appropriate grid or list layout. Verify that items are visually represented (with icons or images) and have clear boundaries. Score 3 if only basic HTML is used without styling, 7 if the backpack has basic styling but lacks visual hierarchy, and 10 if the implementation includes a polished interface with proper spacing, borders, and item slots.",

Check if items have properties (like name, description, type, quantity). Verify that the system manages item stacking or unique items appropriately. Score 3 if only basic item display is implemented, 7 if basic operations work but with limitations, and 10 if all core functionality is present including proper handling of edge cases (full inventory, duplicate items, etc.).",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to inventory management (e.g., embedded mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations for simple interactions). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
