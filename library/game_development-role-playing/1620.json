  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the generated code is executable for display. I want a game about building a sect, with a fictional background, avoiding fantasy, blood, horror, urgent choices, and focusing more on character development. I am the new sect master (16 years old, unmarried), with a family that includes my mother and a minor sibling (brother or sister). The game mainly focuses on recruiting disciples and expanding the sect storyline.\n\nResponse settings: For each round, update the time and character information in the main interface in real-time, wrap all information in separate pseudo code blocks, use asterisks for prompts, quotation marks for dialogues, add emoji expressions, use tree diagrams to show character relationship networks, and ensure code blocks fit mobile display dimensions. Reply \"next month\" to advance to the next month, reply \"restart\" to regenerate character information.",

      "title": "Is the sect building game foundation completely implemented?",
      "description": "Check if the code implements the core game mechanics including time progression system, character attribute tracking, and sect management features. The implementation should handle the player as a 16-year-old sect master with family relationships (mother and sibling). Score 0 if core game loop is missing, 5 if basic mechanics exist but lack depth, 10 if comprehensive sect building mechanics are implemented with proper character relationships.",

      "description": "Evaluate the disciple recruitment mechanism, character attribute growth system, and relationship development features. Check if characters have unique personalities, backgrounds, and development paths. Disciples should have their own motivations and growth trajectories. Deduct 5 points if characters lack distinct personalities, 3 points if growth mechanics are simplistic or linear, and 5 points if there's no meaningful character interaction system.",

      "description": "Review the 'next month' functionality that advances game time and triggers appropriate events. Check if the system includes random events, scheduled storylines, and consequences of previous choices. Event probability should be balanced, with event chains that build on previous player decisions. Deduct 5 points if time progression is buggy, 3 points if events are too repetitive or disconnect from context, and 5 points if there's no state persistence between time jumps.",

      "description": "Assess the tree diagram implementation for character relationship networks. The visualization should be clear, interactive, and update dynamically as relationships evolve. Check if the relationships show hierarchy, loyalty, affection and other relevant metrics between sect master, family members, and disciples. Deduct 5 points if the visualization is static, 5 points if relationships aren't properly tracked in the data model, and 8 points if the tree diagram is unreadable or doesn't render properly on mobile.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to sect building (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
