Make sure the code you generate is executable.\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a dynamic NPC companion system.\n\n**Task**: Implement a dynamic NPC companion system where players can command teammates in combat or puzzle-solving.\n\n**Hint**: You can set up a simple command system such as attack, follow, hold position, and have companions act according to the player's commands.\n\nPlease include some comments in your code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the core command system (attack, follow, hold position) through HTML/JavaScript, including command issuance, command visualization, and command execution by NPCs. Score 0 if no command system is implemented, 5 if only basic commands exist without proper execution logic, and 10 if a complete command system with visual feedback is implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate the AI decision-making logic for NPC companions. Check for state machines or behavior trees that govern NPC responses to commands and environmental conditions. Companion NPCs should exhibit appropriate autonomous behavior when not directly commanded. Deduct 3 points if NPCs lack situational awareness, 5 points if they don't have independent decision-making capabilities, and 3 points if path-finding is missing or broken.

      "description": "Check whether the system includes both combat mechanics (such as targeting, attacking, damage calculation) and puzzle-solving capabilities (such as object interaction, position-based puzzles). NPCs should be able to assist in both contexts based on player commands. Deduct 5 points if either combat or puzzle systems are missing, and 3 points if the implemented systems lack depth or meaningful interaction. The full score is 10 points.",

The system should communicate NPC states clearly to the player.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the NPC companion system (e.g., unrelated game mechanics) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects).
