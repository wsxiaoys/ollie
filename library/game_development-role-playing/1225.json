      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the combat mechanics through HTML/JavaScript, including player attack/defense calculations, monster AI behavior, hit point calculations, and damage formulas. Score 0 if basic combat logic is missing, 5 if only simple attack mechanics exist, and 10 if comprehensive combat system with skills, critical hits, and status effects are fully implemented.",

Deduct 5 points if stat scaling is unbalanced, 3 points if skill progression lacks depth. Full score requires exponential XP curves and meaningful character growth.",

Check if monsters have appropriate AI logic, spawn mechanics, and boss encounters. Deduct 5 points if all monsters behave identically, 3 points if difficulty progression is poorly balanced. Full score requires diverse enemy types with unique mechanics.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases and prevent game-breaking bugs, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to monster-slaying gameplay (e.g., built-in calculator) 3. Performance-heavy effects that cause lag (e.g., excessive particle systems). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core gameplay is interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or no clear architecture; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate exceeds 30%; deduct 3 points if performance is poor (frame drops, memory leaks). Full score requires clean, well-structured code.",

Deduct 5 points for unresponsive controls, 3 points for choppy animations, and 5 points for unclear feedback mechanisms. Full score requires fluid, satisfying gameplay interactions.",
