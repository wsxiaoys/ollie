      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements 3D rendering using WebGL/Three.js or similar technologies, including proper 3D scene setup, camera controls, lighting systems, and terrain/environment models. Check if the 3D world has depth, proper perspective projection, and realistic spatial positioning. Score 0 if only 2D sprites are used, 5 if basic 3D elements exist but lack proper lighting/shadows, and 10 if a complete 3D environment with professional rendering quality is achieved.",

Check if health bars are properly positioned above characters, have smooth animations for health changes, and include status effects visualization. Deduct 5 points if health bars are static or poorly positioned, 3 points if damage calculations are incorrect or missing. Full score requires Pokemon-style health management with smooth transitions and visual polish.",

Evaluate if the controls feel responsive (input lag < 50ms), include animations for different movement states, and support exploration features like item collection, dialogue systems, or quest mechanics. Deduct 5 points if movement is choppy or unresponsive, 5 points if collision detection is missing or buggy.",

Check for thematic consistency in art style, UI design, and game mechanics that evoke the Pokemon adventure experience. Score 0 if no Pokemon-style elements exist, 5 if basic encounter/combat mechanics are present, and 10 if comprehensive adventure systems with proper game flow are implemented.",

Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle WebGL context loss, memory management, and various device capabilities.

Unnecessary features unrelated to the adventure game core (e.g., unrelated mini-games or excessive UI elements) 3. Performance-heavy effects that cause frame drops (e.g., excessive particle systems, unoptimized 3D models).
