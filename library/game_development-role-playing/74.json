      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a complete skill system with experience points allocation, level progression, and skill tree visualization. Score 0 if core skill upgrade functionality is missing, 5 if only basic level-up is implemented without dependencies, and 10 if a complete skill tree with prerequisites and branching paths is fully included.",

Check if the system allows for partial XP allocation, saving unused points, and provides clear feedback on progress toward next level. Deduct 5 points if there's no formula for scaling difficulty, and 3 points if visual progress indicators are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to skill upgrading (e.g., inventory management) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle animations on each skill hover).
