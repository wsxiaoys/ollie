Check if the dialogue content changes based on player choices and if the dialogue flow is properly managed. Score 0 if the core dialogue interaction is not implemented, 5 if only basic dialogue display is implemented without branching, and 10 if the system includes conditional dialogue paths, dialogue history, and proper state management.",

Check if NPCs can store state (like remembering previous conversations) and if their dialogue changes based on player history or game state. Deduct 5 points if NPCs are just static dialogue dispensers without memory, 3 points if there's no variety in NPC personalities or dialogue styles. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify if quests can be accepted, tracked, completed, and rewarded through the dialogue system.
