      "title": "Is the core game mechanics properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code establishes a complete game loop with clear stress-relieving mechanisms. Check for well-defined player interactions, feedback systems, and measurable stress reduction elements. Score 0 if core mechanics are absent, 5 if basic interactions exist but lack engagement, and 10 if the game successfully implements scientifically-backed stress relief mechanisms (e.g., rhythmic interactions, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness elements).",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of equipment collection, management, and utilization. Check for item properties, inventory system, equipment effects on gameplay, and upgrade mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if equipment is purely cosmetic without gameplay impact, 3 points if balance issues exist between items, and 2 points if the equipment UI is unintuitive. Full score requires equipment that meaningfully impacts gameplay with clear progression paths.",

      "title": "Is the level progression system properly designed?",
      "description": "Assess whether the code implements a structured level progression with increasing complexity, appropriate difficulty curves, and meaningful rewards. Check for score tracking, achievement systems, and player progress persistence. Deduct 5 points if levels are repetitive without new challenges, 3 points if difficulty spikes are too severe, and 3 points if progression metrics aren't clearly communicated to the player. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Review the implementation of non-linear exploration elements, such as discoverable areas, hidden content, or branching paths. Check for player agency in navigation, discovery mechanisms, and exploration rewards. Deduct 5 points if exploration areas are too restrictive, 3 points if discovered content lacks meaningful impact, and 3 points if navigation controls are unintuitive. Full implementation should balance guided experience with player freedom.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid inputs, browser compatibility issues, device orientation changes, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle edge cases without crashing, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on performance 3. Mindfulness or breathing exercises integrated into gameplay). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar mechanics (e.g., multiple progress tracking systems) 2. Function modules unrelated to stress relief or game progression 3. Excessive visual effects that may increase cognitive load rather than reduce stress. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core stress-relieving functions are compromised by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state is managed inefficiently; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the game performance degrades noticeably during extended play sessions.

Deduct 3 points for each visually overwhelming element, 5 points for color combinations that induce anxiety, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for jarring or abrupt animations, and 5 points for confusion-inducing UI elements. The full score is 10 points.",
