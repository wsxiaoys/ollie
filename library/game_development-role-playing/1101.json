  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. Help me create a cultivation/immortal progression game that can run directly on a mobile device. Here are my ideas and requirements: At the start of the game, the main character's attribute values are randomly generated. The game should include a training system, equipment system, cultivation techniques and skills system, challenge/dungeon system, log functionality, leveling system, and some simple UI.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements random attribute generation with balanced constraints. Check if attributes include at least 5 core stats (e.g., strength, spirit, agility) with proper min/max ranges and distribution curves. Score 0 if not implemented, 5 if basic randomization exists but lacks balance controls, and 10 if it includes attribute correlation rules and balanced generation algorithms that prevent overpowered initial characters.",

Check for meditation timers, resource consumption, breakthrough mechanics, and bottleneck challenges. Deduct 5 points if cultivation progression is linear without bottlenecks, deduct 3 points if it lacks resource management, and deduct 2 points if there's no visual feedback for cultivation progress.

Examine whether techniques have different cultivation requirements and progression paths.

Function modules unrelated to cultivation gameplay (e.g., mini-games that don't contribute to progression) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects during cultivation).
