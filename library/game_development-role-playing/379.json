  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be careful to ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration. I want to create a game stat allocation simulator - a web version that can be embedded into WordPress. I will give you the rules below. Let's complete this step by step. I hope you will remember the code we create each time.",

      "title": "Is the stat allocation core system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code implements a complete stat allocation system that allows users to distribute points among different attributes. Check if it includes minimum/maximum constraints for each stat, total points limitation, and real-time validation. Score 0 if the core allocation logic is missing, 5 if basic allocation is implemented but lacks constraints, and 10 if the system fully handles allocation rules with proper validation.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can be properly embedded into WordPress as required. Check for WordPress-compatible initialization (e.g., using wp_enqueue_script), proper namespacing to avoid conflicts, and responsive design that adapts to WordPress themes. Deduct 5 points if the code lacks WordPress hooks, 3 points if it doesn't handle theme compatibility, and 2 points if it doesn't use proper WordPress coding standards.",

      "description": "Check if users can save their stat configurations and load them later. Examine whether the solution uses local storage appropriately, includes export/import functionality, and maintains data persistence. Deduct 5 points if saving is implemented but loading is unreliable, 3 points if there's no export/import feature, and give 0 points if no persistence mechanism exists.",

      "description": "Assess whether the simulator provides visual representations of how stat changes affect character abilities or game parameters. Look for graphs, charts, derived stat calculations, or other visual aids. Give 10 points for comprehensive visual feedback with multiple representation options, 5 points for basic feedback, and 0 points if visual representation is absent.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid inputs, script loading errors, browser compatibility issues, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Character preview based on stats). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to stat allocation (e.g., a built-in chat system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear organization of components.

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for jerky animations during stat adjustments, and 5 points for confusing UI state representation. The full score is 10 points.",
