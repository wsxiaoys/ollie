  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable when possible. Create a web-based RPG game featuring a lone warrior wandering through a post-apocalyptic world. The game mechanics should include real-time combat from a top-down perspective, with the character gaining experience and leveling up after defeating enemies. During their journey, the player will acquire numerous treasures. The art style should be realistic.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the character attributes (health, experience, level, attack/defense stats), progression system, and realistic character rendering. Check if the level-up mechanics include stat improvements and provide visual feedback. Score 0 if the core character system is missing, 5 if only basic attributes are implemented, and 10 if the complete progression system with balanced difficulty curves is present.",

Check if the system includes attack cooldowns, dodge/block mechanics, and combat feedback effects.

Check if the world has distinct areas/zones with varying challenges. Deduct 5 points if the environment lacks thematic consistency, and 3 points if collision detection is buggy.

Check if treasures appear at appropriate intervals and if there's a balanced reward system. Deduct 5 points if the inventory UI is dysfunctional, and 3 points if item effects aren't implemented.

Function modules unrelated to a post-apocalyptic RPG (e.g., a built-in social media feed) 3. Graphics effects that severely impact performance (e.g., excessive particle systems).
