      "description": "Review whether the calculator can correctly perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Check for proper order of operations (PEMDAS), decimal handling, and error prevention for division by zero. Score 0 if calculations are incorrect, 5 if basic operations work but with edge case issues, and 10 if all operations work flawlessly with proper error handling.",

Check if the calculator has a clear display for both input and output. Deduct 5 points if the layout is confusing or inconsistent, and 3 points if visual feedback is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if there are clear explanations of how to run the code and how different parts work. Score 0 if no explanations exist, 5 if basic comments are present but insufficient, and 10 if comprehensive guidance is provided.",

Function modules unrelated to a calculator (e.g., unnecessary animations) 3. Overly complex code for simple operations.
