      "description": "Evaluate whether the calculator includes essential production calculation features: input validation, formula parsing, unit conversion, and result formatting. Score 0 if basic arithmetic operations are missing, 5 if only simple calculations are supported, and 10 if comprehensive production formulas (including rate calculations, efficiency metrics, etc.) are implemented.",

      "description": "Check if the code includes proper packaging mechanisms (executable generation, installer creation, dependency bundling). Verify if environment-specific configurations are handled, and if cross-platform compatibility is considered where appropriate. Deduct 5 points if the packaging process is manual, 3 points if dependency management is incomplete. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for export capabilities to common formats (CSV, PDF, etc.) and integration with other systems.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to production calculations (e.g., unnecessary multimedia components) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations in a calculation tool). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
