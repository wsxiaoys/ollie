  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Please use HBuilder to develop a uniapp that calls the Android device camera to measure tree diameter at breast height (DBH), with the following requirements: 1. The interface should be visually appealing and appropriate for the forestry industry; 2. After opening the interface, the device camera should automatically start, displaying the image in the photo area; 3. Add two vertical thin red lines in the photo area as reference lines for tree boundaries, which can be moved manually; 4. When clicking the measurement button, take a photo of the tree while calculating and displaying the DBH measurement result.",

      "title": "Is the camera functionality fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements camera integration through uniapp APIs, including automatic camera startup, real-time preview display, and photo capture functionality. Check if camera permissions are properly requested and handled. Score 0 if camera doesn't work, 5 if only basic capture is implemented, and 10 if all camera features including preview, capture, and permission handling are fully functional.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the two vertical red reference lines are correctly overlaid on the camera preview, can be moved manually through touch gestures, and maintain proper positioning during camera operations. Check if the lines have appropriate visual styling (thin, red, clearly visible). Deduct 5 points if lines are not movable, 3 points if touch interaction is unresponsive, and 5 points if lines disappear during camera operations. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the measurement calculation uses proper scaling algorithms based on reference objects or camera parameters to convert pixel distance to real-world measurements. Evaluate if the algorithm accounts for distance, camera angle, and provides reasonable DBH values. Deduct 5 points if no scaling mechanism exists, 3 points if measurements are consistently inaccurate, and 5 points if the algorithm doesn't handle edge cases. Full score is 10 points.",

Check if the interface includes proper measurement units display, clear result presentation, and forestry-specific visual elements. Deduct 5 points if the design looks generic, 3 points if forestry context is missing, and 5 points if the interface appears unprofessional. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle camera failures, permission issues, and measurement edge cases, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to tree measurement (e.g., built-in photo filters) 3. Excessive visual effects that impact performance (e.g., complex animations during measurement).
