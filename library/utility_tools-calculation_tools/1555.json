      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the calculation formulas based on the 'Technical Code for Building Pile Foundations'. Check if all required parameters are included (such as anchor diameter, embedded depth, concrete strength, etc.) and if the calculations follow the standard equations. Score 0 if calculations are missing, 5 if basic calculations are implemented but with errors, and 10 if all formulas are correctly implemented according to the technical code.",

Check if the code validates input ranges according to the technical standards (e.g., minimum/maximum values for bolt diameters, concrete strength grades). Deduct 3 points for each missing critical parameter, 2 points for inadequate validation, and 5 points if the units of measurement are inconsistent or unclear.

Check for clear labeling of input fields with units, appropriate use of engineering terminology, logical grouping of related inputs, and presentation of results with proper significant figures. Deduct 3 points for confusing terminology, 3 points for poor input organization, and 4 points if results lack proper engineering context or units.
