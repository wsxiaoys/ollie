      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a 30-minute countdown timer with proper time calculations. Check for accurate second-by-second countdown, correct time formatting (MM:SS), and proper termination when reaching zero. Score 0 if the timer doesn't work at all, 5 if it has minor time calculation errors, and 10 if it precisely counts down from 30 minutes to zero.",

      "description": "Check whether the timer provides visual feedback during the countdown process. This could include changing colors as time decreases, progress indicators, or visual cues when reaching specific time thresholds (e.g., last 5 minutes, last minute). Deduct 5 points if no visual feedback exists beyond the numbers changing, give 5 points for basic visual feedback, and 10 points for comprehensive visual indicators that enhance user awareness of time progression.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to a countdown timer (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the page). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global variables are excessively used or if the code structure is chaotic; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no error handling or if the code is poorly commented.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for poor readability of the timer digits. The full score is 10 points.",
