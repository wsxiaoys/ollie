      "description": "Check whether the code implements a comprehensive form for collecting essential car data (make, model, year, mileage, condition). The form should include proper validation with real-time feedback. Score 0 if the core form is missing, 5 if basic fields are implemented but lack validation, and 10 if a complete form with validation and field dependencies (e.g., model options changing based on selected make) is implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes a reasonable valuation algorithm that considers multiple factors (age depreciation, mileage impact, condition multipliers, market trends). Deduct 5 points if only basic linear depreciation is used. Deduct 3 points if market adjustments are missing. The algorithm should be well-commented and account for edge cases (very old/new cars, extremely low/high mileage). Full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper cross-platform adaptations and lifecycle hooks. Deduct 5 points if platform-specific code is not properly conditioned. Deduct 3 points if uniapp's built-in navigation isn't utilized.

Evaluate whether a state management solution is used for complex state (Vuex/Pinia). Deduct 5 points if offline mode isn't supported, 3 points if there's no way to retrieve previous assessments.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to car assessment (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations on value display). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no configuration for different environments (development/production).
