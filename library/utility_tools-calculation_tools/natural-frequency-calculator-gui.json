      "description": "Evaluate whether the code accurately implements mathematical formulas for calculating first, second, and third-order natural frequencies. Check for proper use of physics/engineering formulas, correct dimensional analysis, and numerical stability. Score 0 if calculations are incorrect, 5 if basic calculations are implemented with minor issues, and 10 if calculations are mathematically sound with validation checks.",

Check for essential GUI components (input fields, buttons, result displays). Deduct 5 points if the interface lacks proper layout, 3 points if input validation is missing.
