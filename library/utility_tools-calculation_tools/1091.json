      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements all necessary mortgage calculation formulas (principal and interest calculation for equal installments, equal principal payment, etc.), supports different loan types (commercial, housing provident fund, combined), and allows for varying interest rates and terms. Score 0 if basic calculation is missing, 5 if only one loan type is supported, and 10 if all standard mortgage options are included.",

Deduct 3 points if any critical parameter is missing, deduct 2 points if parameter validation is incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for each missing comparison feature, and 5 points if scenario testing is completely absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Code should validate inputs, prevent calculation errors with zero or negative values, and handle decimal precision properly. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic validation, and 0 points if validation is absent.",

Function modules unrelated to mortgage calculation (e.g., unrelated financial tools) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations in calculation screens).
