      "title": "Is the core profit calculation functionality fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the fundamental profit calculation formulas (Revenue - COGS - Expenses), with proper handling of different units (currency, percentages). Score 0 if the core calculation is not implemented, 5 if basic calculations are present but missing important metrics like margins or ROI, and 10 if all essential e-commerce metrics (gross/net profit, margins, ROI, break-even analysis) are included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code handles all necessary e-commerce variables: product costs, selling price, shipping fees, payment processing fees, marketing costs, returns/refunds rate, taxes, and operational costs. Deduct 2 points for each critical missing variable. Check if validation is in place to prevent nonsensical inputs (negative prices, percentages over 100%). The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the tool includes visualizations (charts, graphs) showing profit breakdown, contribution margins, or break-even analysis. Score 0 if no visualizations are present, 5 if basic charts are implemented but lack interactivity or clarity, and 10 if comprehensive, interactive visualizations with proper labeling and color-coding are implemented.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code allows users to compare different pricing strategies, product mixes, or perform what-if analyses. Check if the tool can save multiple scenarios and display side-by-side comparisons. Deduct 5 points if only single-scenario calculations are supported. The full score is 10 points if users can interactively adjust variables and see immediate impact on profitability.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid inputs, type errors, division by zero, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Dynamic pricing recommendations based on profitability targets 3. Export functionality to CSV/PDF). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to profit calculation (e.g., unnecessary product catalog features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no validation or sanitization of inputs. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the overall design follows modern design principles: 1) Harmonious color matching (no more than 3 primary colors) 2) Proper layout spacing (element spacing follows the 8px multiple principle) 3) Professional font system (body font size â‰¥ 14px, line height over 1.5 times). Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for delayed calculation feedback, 3 points for jarring visual updates when recalculating, and 5 points for hard-to-find key function buttons. The full score is 10 points.",
