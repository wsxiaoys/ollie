Check if the timer shows correct numerical values and updates in real-time.Score 0 if the timer doesn't work at all, 5 if it only shows basic counting without proper formatting, 10 if it fully implements a professional time display with proper formatting and precision.",

Test edge cases like rapid clicking of controls and verify proper state management between different control actions.Deduct 3 points if any basic control is missing, 2 points if controls don't handle edge cases, and 3 points if state transitions between controls are buggy.

Check if the implementation uses efficient methods like requestAnimationFrame or setInterval with drift compensation instead of naive setTimeout chains.Deduct 5 points for timer drift exceeding 1 second per minute of running time, 3 points for inefficient implementation causing performance issues, 2 points if the timer fails after extended periods.
