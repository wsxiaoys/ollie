      "title": "Is the clock display mechanism accurately implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements real-time display through HTML/CSS/JavaScript, including precise hour/minute/second hand positioning, correct time calculation logic, and proper coordinate system for analog clock face. Score 0 if basic time display is not working, 5 if only digital time is shown, and 10 if both analog and digital clocks are perfectly synchronized with accurate mathematical calculations for hand angles.",

      "title": "Is the real-time update functionality properly implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the JavaScript implementation includes efficient timing mechanisms (setInterval/requestAnimationFrame), smooth animation transitions for clock hands, and proper memory management to prevent performance degradation. Deduct 5 points if timing drift occurs after extended running, and 3 points if animations are choppy or inconsistent. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Are multiple time formats and display modes supported?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the clock supports different time formats (12/24 hour), multiple timezone displays, and various visual styles (analog/digital/hybrid). Check if timezone conversion is mathematically correct and if format switching works seamlessly. Deduct 5 points if timezone calculations are incorrect, and 3 points if format switching causes display glitches. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the code includes customization options such as theme switching, size adjustment, color schemes, and clock face styles. Evaluate if settings persist across sessions and if customization affects performance. Deduct 5 points if customization options don't save properly, and 3 points if theme changes cause layout breaks. Give 10 points if fully implemented with smooth transitions.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as system time changes, browser tab switching, invalid date inputs, etc.) and provide friendly error handling or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like leap seconds, daylight saving time transitions, and browser compatibility issues, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Stopwatch with lap timing 4. Pomodoro timer integration 5. Voice time announcements). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar timing functions (e.g., multiple interval timers coexisting) 2. Function modules unrelated to clock functionality (e.g., built-in calculator or weather widget) 3. Excessive visual effects that impact performance (e.g., complex particle systems or heavy animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core clock functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

      "description": "Review modular design (such as separating time logic/display/animation layers), performance optimization techniques, and code maintainability. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or proper separation of concerns is missing; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if performance optimization opportunities are missed (e.g., unnecessary DOM manipulations).

Deduct 3 points for each poorly readable element, 5 points for jarring color combinations that strain the eyes, and 5 points for disproportional or cramped layouts. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each jerky or inaccurate hand movement, 3 points for mathematical errors in angle calculations, and 5 points for performance issues during extended operation.
