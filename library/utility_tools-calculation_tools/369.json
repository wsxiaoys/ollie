      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements multiple geometric shape drawing through HTML5 Canvas/SVG, including basic shapes (lines, circles, rectangles, polygons) and advanced shapes (bezier curves, arcs). Check if the drawing implements precise coordinate tracking, real-time preview during drawing, and shape completion validation. Score 0 if core drawing logic is missing, 5 if only basic shapes are implemented, and 10 if comprehensive geometric shapes with smooth drawing experience are fully included.",

Check if measurement tools provide visual feedback with measurement lines/arcs overlay. Deduct 5 points if measurement accuracy is below 95%, and 3 points if visual measurement indicators are unclear. Full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if mouse/touch event handling supports both desktop and mobile interactions. Deduct 5 points if undo/redo is missing, 3 points if zoom functionality is not smooth, and 2 points if mobile touch support is inadequate. Full score is 10 points.",

Check if the system maintains drawing layer management and shape property editing capabilities. Deduct 5 points if save/load functionality is missing, 3 points if export quality is poor, and 2 points if drawing history is not maintained.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases including canvas performance optimization for complex drawings. Give 10 points for excellent robustness, 5 points for average handling, and 0 points if no exceptions are handled.",

Color palette with custom color mixing 4. Geometric construction tools like compass and ruler simulation 5. Real-time coordinate display).

Function modules unrelated to geometric drawing (e.g., built-in games or unrelated utilities) 3. Fancy effects that affect drawing performance (e.g., excessive animations during drawing). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core drawing functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or no design patterns are used; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is too high (over 25%); deduct 3 points if drawing performance is not optimized for complex scenes.
