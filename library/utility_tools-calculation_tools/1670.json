Please provide a lightweight solution for a marriage compatibility calculator mini-program based on the Chinese BaZi (Eight Characters) system for matchmaking agencies or fortune-telling services. Include core functionalities, technical implementation paths, and commercialization suggestions, along with open-source program code that can be quickly implemented even with zero coding background.",

Check if the code handles special cases like leap months and date boundary conditions. Score 0 if the core calculation is incorrect, 5 if basic calculations are implemented but with minor errors, and 10 if all calculations including Stems and Branches are accurately implemented with proper documentation.",

Check if the algorithm calculates both major compatibility indicators (e.g., day master relationships) and minor influences.

Check if validation is implemented to prevent impossible dates or nonsensical inputs.
