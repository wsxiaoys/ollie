      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements basic timer functions including start/pause/reset/stop operations through HTML/JavaScript, and whether it includes time display formatting (hours:minutes:seconds) and countdown/countup modes. Score 0 if core timing logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic start/stop is implemented, and 10 if all essential timer features are fully included.",

The code should be educational with explanations of basic programming concepts used. Deduct 5 points if comments are insufficient for beginners, and 3 points if variable names are not self-explanatory. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the solution provides a clear learning path starting from basic HTML structure, then CSS styling, and finally JavaScript functionality. Should include explanations of why each technology is needed and how they work together. Deduct 5 points if the progression jumps complexity levels too quickly. Check whether prerequisite knowledge is explained before introducing new concepts. The full score is 10 points.",

Should provide clear instructions on how to customize without breaking functionality. Deduct 5 points if no customization guidance is provided, and 3 points if modifications require advanced programming knowledge. Give 10 points if fully implemented with beginner-friendly customization options.",

Code should include input validation and graceful error handling with clear explanations of what went wrong and how to fix it. Give 10 points for strong robustness, 5 points if average, and 0 points if no error handling exists.",

Visual debugging aids or console logging explanations 4. Comparison with alternative implementation approaches. Add 3 points for each practical learning feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Unrelated functionality that distracts from timer learning (e.g., complex animations or unrelated widgets) 3. Multiple ways to accomplish the same task without educational purpose. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core learning objectives are obscured by unnecessary complexity.",

Check for appropriate use of modern web standards while keeping complexity manageable for beginners. Deduct 5 points if code organization is confusing for learners; deduct 5 points if outdated or non-standard practices are used without explanation; deduct 5 points if the learning curve is too steep.
