      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements the Chinese calendar conversion and Bazi calculation logic. Check if it accurately derives the Year, Month, Day, and Hour pillars with their respective Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. Score 0 if the core calculation is incorrect, 5 if only basic conversion is implemented without considering special cases (leap months), and 10 if all aspects including special cases are handled correctly.",
