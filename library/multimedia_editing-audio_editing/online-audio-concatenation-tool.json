      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements multi-file audio upload through HTML5 File API, and whether it includes support for common audio formats (MP3, WAV, AAC, OGG). Check if audio format validation, file size limits, and format conversion capabilities are included. Score 0 if core upload functionality is not implemented, 5 if only basic single-file upload is supported, and 10 if multi-format batch upload with validation is fully implemented.",

      "description": "Check whether the Web Audio API or similar technology is properly implemented for audio concatenation, including audio buffer management, seamless audio stitching, and real-time preview capabilities. Evaluate if the concatenation maintains audio quality without distortion. Deduct 5 points if audio gaps or clicks are present during concatenation, and 3 points if real-time preview is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the interface provides intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for reordering audio clips, including visual feedback during dragging, drop zone indicators, and smooth animation transitions. Check if the interface displays audio waveforms, duration, and file names clearly. Deduct 5 points if drag-and-drop is non-functional or clunky, and 3 points if visual feedback is poor.

Evaluate if the export process includes progress indicators and handles large file exports efficiently. Deduct 5 points if export functionality is missing or limited to one format, and 3 points if no progress feedback is provided during export. Give 10 points if fully implemented with multiple format support.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as corrupted audio files, unsupported formats, memory limitations, browser compatibility issues, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle file size limits, audio processing errors, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic error handling, and 0 points if no exceptions are handled.",

Audio fade-in/fade-out effects between clips 3. Batch processing with templates 4. Audio normalization and volume adjustment 5. Keyboard shortcuts for power users).

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple upload handlers coexisting) 2. Function modules unrelated to audio processing (e.g., built-in video editor) 3. Heavy effects that impact audio processing performance (e.g., complex 3D visualizations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core audio functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

      "description": "Review modular design (such as separating audio processing/UI/file handling layers), error handling patterns, and code organization. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or proper separation of concerns is missing; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if no proper audio cleanup/disposal is implemented.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for poor color contrast affecting usability, and 5 points for confusing layout of audio controls. The full score is 10 points.",
