      "description": "Evaluate if the code includes a well-structured system architecture that integrates AI models for music generation. Check if the architecture includes data preprocessing, model loading, inference pipeline, and output processing components. Score 0 if no AI architecture is present, 5 if basic components exist but lack integration, and 10 if the architecture is comprehensive with clear data flow between components.",

Verify API usage correctness, proper error handling for API calls, and appropriate model parameter management. Deduct 5 points if integration is superficial without proper error handling, and 3 points if parameter tuning options are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if these parameters have appropriate validation and reasonable defaults. Deduct 3 points for each major missing control (tempo/key/style), and 2 points if parameter bounds checking is inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the code handles different sample rates and bit depths correctly. Deduct 3 points for missing export formats, 5 points for inadequate audio playback, and 5 points if audio processing has potential memory leaks or performance issues. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to music generation (e.g., unnecessary image processing) 3. Resource-intensive features that affect performance (e.g., excessive logging, unnecessary real-time processing).
