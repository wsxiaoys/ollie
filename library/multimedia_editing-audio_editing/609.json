  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration. ======== ROLE ========\nYou are an experienced code expert. I am providing you with a software development requirement description and asking you to generate project code based on these requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code with simple and understandable comments, without outputting anything else.\n\n======== OUTPUT RULES ========\n1. Always generate complete, runnable project code, ensuring the project is fully executable\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete, without omitting any code\n3. Carefully review and check all code before final output, evaluating its executability. If the code cannot run or contains errors, regenerate it\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide simulated data\n\n======== PROJECT REQUIREMENTS ========\nDesign a frontend audio watermark creator where users can upload audio files and watermark audio files (or text watermark information). The interface should provide options for watermark placement (beginning, middle, end, etc.) and volume adjustment. After setting these options, users should be able to save the watermarked audio to their local device.",

Check if audio visualization (waveform display) is provided for user feedback. Score 0 if basic upload is not implemented, 5 if only basic file handling exists without audio processing, and 10 if complete audio upload with validation and visualization is included.",

Check if multiple placement options (beginning, middle, end, custom position) are available with precise timing controls. Verify if volume adjustment for watermarks is implemented with real-time preview. Deduct 5 points if only one watermark type is supported, 3 points if position control is imprecise, and 2 points if volume adjustment lacks real-time feedback. Full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if the audio processing maintains original quality while adding watermarks. Verify if the system handles different audio formats and bit rates correctly.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to audio watermarking (e.g., built-in music player or audio editor) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., complex 3D visualizations that slow down processing).
