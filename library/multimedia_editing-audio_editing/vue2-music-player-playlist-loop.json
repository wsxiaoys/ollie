      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements the essential audio playback controls (play, pause, stop, seek, volume control) using the HTML5 Audio API or a similar technology within Vue 2. Check if proper event listeners are attached for audio events (ended, timeupdate, loadedmetadata). Score 0 if core functionality is missing, 5 if basic controls are present but incomplete, and 10 if all controls work with proper error handling.",

Each mode should have clear state management and visual indicators. Deduct 3 points for each missing mode, 2 points if the randomization algorithm is flawed (e.g., allows immediate repeats), and 2 points if mode switching isn't smooth. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the data structure for managing the playlist is efficient and maintains proper state across playback mode changes. Deduct 5 points if the playlist is hard-coded with no manipulation functions, 3 points if the current song isn't properly highlighted, and 3 points if playlist state isn't preserved when switching modes.

Check if the player state remains consistent after errors. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to music playback (e.g., unnecessary external services) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations that cause lag during playback). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state is managed poorly or Vue reactivity isn't leveraged properly; deduct 5 points if the code has high duplication; deduct 5 points if prop drilling is excessive instead of using a proper state management pattern.

Check if the player has a consistent visual language and clear visual hierarchy.
