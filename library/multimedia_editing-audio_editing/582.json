Implement a web tool that allows users to record local audio (such as microphone input), with features for recording, pausing, re-recording, and saving as an audio file.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the core MediaRecorder API with proper event handling for starting, stopping, and capturing audio data. Check if the microphone access permission is properly requested and errors are handled. Score 0 if recording functionality is missing, 5 if basic recording works with issues, and 10 for a complete implementation with proper state management.",

Deduct 2.5 points for each missing feature. Check if the state transitions between these operations are handled correctly (e.g., can't pause before recording starts). The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the implementation uses proper Blob handling and download mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if only one format is supported, 7 points if the download mechanism is flawed, and 10 points if saving functionality is missing completely.",

Check if the AudioContext API is used for visualization. Deduct 5 points if there's no visual feedback, 3 points if the visualization is basic (just a recording indicator), and give full 10 points if there's real-time waveform or frequency visualization.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to audio recording (e.g., irrelevant media players) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that impact recording quality). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
