  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be careful to ensure that any code you generate is executable. Please implement an AI-based audio restoration tool where users can upload audio files containing noise, distortion, or poor sound quality, and the system will automatically detect and repair these issues through algorithms. The tool should provide functions such as noise reduction, distortion repair, volume normalization, and audio quality enhancement, and allow users to adjust the repair intensity through parameters. The interface should display before-and-after waveform comparisons, allowing users to visually experience the restoration effects.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes a robust mechanism for uploading audio files (supporting common formats like MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG), proper validation of file types and sizes, and error handling for corrupt files. Check if the audio processing pipeline correctly decodes the audio for further manipulation with proper memory management. Score 0 if basic upload is missing, 5 if only basic formats are supported without validation, and 10 if comprehensive upload handling with proper error management is implemented.",

Deduct 3 points for each missing algorithm. Award full points only if implementations include proper signal processing principles with AI integration (ML models, neural networks, or advanced DSP techniques).",

Check if real-time preview capability exists, parameter presets are available, and tooltips explain each parameter's function.

Check for synchronized playback indicators, zoom functionality, highlighting of modified sections, and ability to switch between waveform/spectrogram views. Waveforms should update in real-time when parameters change.
