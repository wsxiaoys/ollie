      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements media file loading, playback control (play/pause/stop), seek functionality, and volume control through Python/Kivy. Must include support for common media formats (MP4, MP3, AVI, etc.) and proper error handling for unsupported formats. Score 0 if core playback is not implemented, 5 if only basic play/pause works, and 10 if all standard media controls are fully functional with format validation.",

      "description": "Check whether the implementation includes proper streaming protocols (HTTP, RTSP, HLS) support, buffering mechanisms, and adaptive bitrate handling. Must handle network interruptions gracefully with buffer status indicators. Deduct 5 points if no buffering strategy is implemented, 3 points if stream reconnection fails, and 5 points if no adaptive quality control exists. Full score requires seamless streaming with buffer management.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the player includes playlist creation, file queue management, shuffle/repeat modes, and next/previous track navigation. Should support drag-and-drop reordering and persistent playlist storage. Deduct 5 points if no playlist functionality exists, 3 points if queue operations are buggy, and 2 points if no persistence mechanism is provided. Full implementation requires complete playlist ecosystem.",

Must show current playback position with seekable timeline. Deduct 5 points if no metadata display exists, 3 points if progress tracking is inaccurate, and 2 points if no visual feedback for media information is provided. Full score requires rich media information display.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as corrupted media files, network timeouts, unsupported codecs, file permission errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to media playback (e.g., built-in games or calculators) 3. Performance-heavy effects that don't add value (e.g., excessive animations during video playback). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core media functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or MVC pattern is not followed; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if Kivy best practices are ignored (improper widget lifecycle management).
