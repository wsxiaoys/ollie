  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the code generated is executable for demonstration.\n\n## Role ##\nYou are an experienced code expert. You are now provided with a software development requirement description, and you are asked to generate project code based on this requirement. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code with simple and easy-to-understand language comments, and don't output anything else.\n\n## Output Rules ##\n1. You will always generate complete runnable project code. Please ensure that the project is complete and executable\n2. Ensure that all code files you output are complete, without omitting any code\n3. Carefully review and check all code before the final output to evaluate its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, it needs to be regenerated\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or need to use user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide mock data\n\n## Project Requirements Description ##\nPlease develop a timeline-based audio annotation tool suitable for music teachers, audio editors, or collaborators. Users can upload audio files, then add text comments, voice annotations, or graphical markers at specific points on the timeline. Other users can view these annotations, add replies, forming a conversation. The system should support filtering by annotation type, exporting annotation summaries, and automatically pausing and displaying annotations at the corresponding position during audio playback.",
