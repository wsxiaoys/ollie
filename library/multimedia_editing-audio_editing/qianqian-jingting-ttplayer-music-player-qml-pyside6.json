      "description": "Evaluate whether the QML interface properly implements the distinctive Qianqian Jingting (TTPlayer) visual style, including the classic blue gradient color scheme, semi-transparent design elements, reflective surfaces, and rounded corners. Score 0 if the design bears no resemblance to TTPlayer, 5 if basic styling is present but lacks defining characteristics, and 10 if the interface is nearly indistinguishable from the original TTPlayer aesthetic.",

Verify that MediaPlayer or similar QML elements are properly integrated with audio sources.

Check that signals and slots are properly connected, Python models are exposed to QML correctly, and file system operations are handled by PySide6.

Check that visualizations are responsive to audio in real-time using FFT analysis or similar techniques.

Function modules unrelated to music playback (e.g., a built-in web browser) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that consume CPU).
