  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Design an audio echo effect processor where users can upload audio files, select echo delay time and intensity, and preview the echo effect in real-time. After editing, users can export the audio file with the echo effect applied.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements audio file upload with support for multiple formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.), includes proper file validation and size limits, and accurately parses audio data using Web Audio API or similar technology. Check if waveform visualization is provided for uploaded audio. Score 0 if basic upload is not working, 5 if only basic upload without validation is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive file handling with format support and validation is included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the echo effect uses proper digital signal processing techniques with configurable delay time (typically 50ms-2000ms range) and intensity/feedback controls (0-100% range). Check if the implementation uses delay buffers, feedback loops, and proper mixing algorithms. Verify that the echo parameters produce audible and mathematically correct results. Deduct 5 points if delay timing is inaccurate, 3 points if intensity control doesn't work properly. Full score requires professional-grade audio processing.",

Evaluate if the preview updates immediately when parameters change and includes proper audio buffer management. Verify that playback controls (play/pause/seek) work correctly with processed audio. Deduct 5 points if latency exceeds 200ms, 3 points if parameter changes don't update in real-time. Full score requires seamless real-time processing.",

Check if the export process handles long audio files efficiently and provides progress indication. Deduct 5 points if export quality is degraded, 3 points if only one format is supported, 5 points if no progress indication for long exports. Full score requires professional export capabilities.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle audio processing errors, file size limitations, and browser audio context issues, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to audio echo processing (e.g., built-in video player or image editor) 3. Excessive visual effects that impact audio processing performance (e.g., complex 3D visualizations during real-time processing).
