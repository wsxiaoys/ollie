  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable. \n\n======== Role ========\nYou are an experienced code expert. You are given a software development requirement description and asked to generate project code according to this requirement. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code with simple and easy-to-understand language comments. Do not output anything else.\n\n======== Output Rules ========\n1. You should always generate complete, runnable project code. Please ensure the project is complete and executable.\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete, do not omit any code.\n3. Before the final output, carefully review and check all code to evaluate its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, it needs to be regenerated.\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or require user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide simulated data.\n\n======== Project Requirements ========\nCreate a frontend tool for audio mixing and audio effect combination, where users can upload multiple audio files for mixing, and can add various audio effects (such as echo, noise reduction, etc.) to the mixed audio. After processing, users can preview and download the final audio.",

Check if users can manage (add/remove/reorder) uploaded audio files.

Check whether the code includes volume adjustment for each track, timing synchronization options, mute/solo options for individual tracks, and proper gain node management. Verify that the mixing process preserves audio quality without unintended clipping or distortion.

Check if each effect has appropriate parameters that users can adjust. Verify that effects can be applied selectively to individual tracks or to the master output. Effects should be implemented using proper audio processing nodes with real-time preview capabilities. Score 0 if no effects are implemented, 5 if only basic effects with limited customization, and 10 if a comprehensive suite of professional-grade effects with full parameter customization is available.",

Evaluate the download functionality, including proper file format options (MP3, WAV, etc.), quality settings, metadata preservation, and appropriate file naming. Verify that the final download accurately represents what was heard in the preview.

Check for proper exception handling around audio processing operations, which are prone to errors. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points.
