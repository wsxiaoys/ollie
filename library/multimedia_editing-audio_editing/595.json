      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a complete audio file upload mechanism that supports common audio formats (MP3, WAV, AAC, etc.), validates file sizes (limiting to reasonable sizes like 50MB), and provides proper user feedback during the upload process. Deduct 5 points if format validation is missing, 3 points if error handling for corrupt files is absent, and 2 points if upload progress indication is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if visualization is missing, 5 points if basic waveform is displayed without interactive features, and 10 points if the visualization is fully interactive with accurate representation of the audio amplitude.",

Deduct 5 points if trimming is imprecise (lacking millisecond accuracy), 3 points if zooming functionality is missing, and 2 points if visual indicators for trim points are unclear.

Deduct 3 points if tag editing is limited, 4 points if visual representation on the timeline is missing, and 3 points if tag search/filtering capabilities are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to audio editing (e.g., excessive social sharing options) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow down the audio processing).
