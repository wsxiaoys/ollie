      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the sound library architecture, including categorization of sound effects, audio playback engine, and preview functionality. Score 0 if the core audio playback is not implemented, 5 if only basic playback is implemented without proper controls, and 10 if the system includes comprehensive playback with volume control, seeking, and visualization.",

Deduct 3 points if search functionality is missing, 4 points if there's no categorization system, and 3 points if filtering options are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if preview quality matches download quality. Deduct 5 points if waveform visualization is missing, 3 points if loop functionality is absent, and 2 points if preview quality is significantly lower. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to sound effects library (e.g., extensive video editing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect audio performance (e.g., excessive animations during playback).
