      "description": "Review whether the code implements a clear and accurate transit map using HTML/SVG/Canvas, with proper representation of routes, stations, and transfer points. Score 0 if no map is implemented, 5 if a basic static map is provided, and 10 if an interactive map with zoom/pan functionality is implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether users can search for routes between stations with options for fastest/shortest routes, departure times, and transit preferences. Check if the algorithm accounts for transfer times and service frequencies. Deduct 5 points if only basic point-to-point routing exists, 3 points if time-based planning is missing. Give 10 points if advanced features like multi-criteria optimization are included.",

Verify if data refresh mechanisms and API integration points exist. Score 0 if no real-time features exist, 5 if basic updates are implemented, and 10 if comprehensive real-time functionality with fallback mechanisms is included.",

Check for media queries, flexible layouts, and touch-friendly controls on mobile. Deduct 5 points if the layout breaks on certain devices, and 3 points if mobile-specific optimizations are missing.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to public transit (e.g., weather forecasts unrelated to travel) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow page loading). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
