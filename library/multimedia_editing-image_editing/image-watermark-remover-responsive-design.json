Be sure to ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration. I want to create an application that can remove watermarks from images, with the ability to either freely select areas or automatically detect areas for removal. Please provide me with code that I can use on both computer and mobile devices, with responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.",

Check if the implementation allows for adjusting parameters to handle different types of watermarks (semi-transparent, opaque, pattern-based).0 points if basic image processing is missing, 5 points if only simple opacity-based removal is implemented, 10 points for comprehensive multi-technique approach with parameter adjustments.",

Check if the manual selection includes precision tools like edge refinement and feathering controls. Verify that automatic detection can handle common watermark types through methods like frequency analysis or pattern recognition.Deduct 5 points if only rectangular selection is available, 3 points if automatic detection is unreliable across different image types. Full 10 points requires both flexible manual selection and effective automatic detection.",

Check for features like split-screen view, opacity slider for comparison, and zoom capabilities to examine details.Deduct 5 points if preview is only available after processing, 3 points if comparison tools are limited.

Check for graceful degradation when optimal performance isn't possible.Evaluate whether the code handles common abnormal situations (such as invalid images, memory overflow, browser compatibility issues) and provides friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
