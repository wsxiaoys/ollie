      "description": "Check whether the code correctly integrates Paper.js with Vue 3, implements proper canvas initialization, and provides fundamental drawing capabilities (pencil tool). Score 0 if Paper.js is not properly initialized, 5 if only basic drawing is implemented without proper event handling, and 10 if the implementation includes proper path creation, stroke management, and tool selection with appropriate event binding.",

Deduct 2 points for each missing essential tool. Additionally, check for basic operations like undo/redo functionality (deduct 3 points if missing). The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code follows Vue 3 best practices: using Composition API correctly, proper lifecycle hooks management for canvas initialization/cleanup, and component-based architecture for tools and UI elements. Check if reactivity is properly handled for drawing state. Deduct 3 points if using Options API inappropriately, 3 points if Paper.js instances aren't properly managed in the component lifecycle, and 5 points if the implementation doesn't leverage Vue's reactivity system properly.

Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Smart selection tool that recognizes drawing objects, 3. Background templates/grids, 4. Multi-layer support, 5. Export to multiple formats).

Function modules unrelated to drawing (e.g., a built-in image gallery not tied to drawing) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that impact drawing responsiveness). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process lacks optimization for canvas performance.
