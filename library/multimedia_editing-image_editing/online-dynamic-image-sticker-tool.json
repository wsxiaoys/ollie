  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Please develop an online dynamic sticker tool where users can upload images and add animated stickers (such as animated emojis, dynamic text effects, etc.) to their images. Users should be able to adjust the position, size, and animation effects of the stickers, preview the dynamic effects, and then download the processed image in GIF or video format.",

      "description": "Review whether the code supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP) with proper file validation, size limits, and error handling. Check if image preview, canvas rendering, and memory management are properly implemented. Score 0 if basic upload is missing, 5 if only basic upload works without validation, and 10 if complete image processing pipeline with optimization is included.",

Check if stickers support multiple formats (GIF, CSS animations, Canvas animations) and include proper loading states. Deduct 5 points if animation performance is poor (>16ms frame time), 3 points if sticker categories are limited (<10 types). Full score requires 20+ animated stickers with smooth performance.",

Evaluate if the system includes snap-to-grid, multi-select, undo/redo, and transform handles. Require smooth drag-and-drop with visual feedback. Deduct 5 points if transformation controls are clunky or imprecise, 3 points if layering/z-index management is missing. Full score needs pixel-perfect control with gesture support.",

Check if export supports multiple formats (GIF, MP4, WebM) with quality/size options and progress indicators. Deduct 5 points if preview doesn't match final export, 5 points if export quality is poor or fails frequently. Require frame-accurate preview and reliable multi-format export.",

Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle edge cases like network failures during upload, canvas memory limits, and animation conflicts, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Collaborative editing with real-time sharing 3. Advanced animation timeline editor 4. Social sharing with custom templates 5. Voice-to-text animated captions).

Function modules unrelated to sticker editing (e.g., built-in photo filters or games) 3. Performance-heavy effects that don't add value (e.g., excessive particle systems or 3D transforms).

Deduct 5 points if memory leaks are found in animation loops or canvas operations; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance monitoring or optimization is implemented.
