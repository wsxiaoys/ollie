Check if the image is properly loaded for processing with appropriate resolution/size handling. Score 0 if image upload is not implemented, 5 if basic upload exists but with limitations, 10 if fully implemented with comprehensive error handling and preview functionality.",

Verify if the contours are properly identified and stored as vector paths or coordinate sets. Examine if the code handles various image conditions (high contrast, low contrast, noise). Deduct 5 points if only basic edge detection is implemented without proper contour extraction, 3 points if noise handling is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the code correctly identifies hierarchical relationships between contours and assigns appropriate depth values. Verify if the depth estimation accounts for contour size, position, and nesting level. The algorithm should handle complex cases like islands (contours within contours). Deduct 5 points if the depth estimation is simplistic (e.g., only counting nesting levels), 3 points if it doesn't handle special cases like disconnected contours. Score 10 if the depth estimation is comprehensive and accurate.",

Check if the code includes a variety of realistic refractive materials (e.g., glass, water, crystal) with physically plausible parameters. Verify if the texturing accounts for depth relationships between layers with appropriate visual outcomes. Deduct 5 points if only basic color filling is used instead of true refractive effects, 3 points if the refraction parameters aren't depth-dependent.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core task (e.g., unnecessary image filters) 3. Computationally expensive effects that significantly slow processing without proportional quality improvement.
