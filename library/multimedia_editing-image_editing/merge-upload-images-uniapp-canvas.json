      "description": "Verify that the code correctly loads and merges two images on a canvas element compatible with UniApp. Check if it handles different image sizes (scaling/positioning), maintains aspect ratios, and processes images without distortion. Score 0 if canvas merging is not implemented, 5 if basic merging is done without handling edge cases, and 10 if the solution is comprehensive with proper error handling for image loading.",

Check if conditional code is used to handle platform-specific issues, and if polyfills are implemented where needed.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
