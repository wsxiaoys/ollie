Make sure that the code you generate is executable and can be demonstrated. Develop an online image compression tool where users can upload images, view the compressed file size and compression ratio, preview the compression effect in real-time, and choose from various compression level options.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements file upload with proper validation for image formats (at minimum JPG, PNG, GIF), handles file size limits, and provides progress indication during upload. Check for error handling when invalid file types are selected or upload fails. Score 0 if upload functionality is missing, 5 if basic upload works but lacks validation/error handling, and 10 if fully implemented with all necessary validations and user feedback.",

Check if it properly maintains aspect ratio, handles different color profiles, and applies proper quality reduction techniques. Deduct 5 points if only a single compression method is available, 3 points if important parameters like quality factor are not adjustable. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if comparison requires page reload, 3 points if there's no zoom functionality for detail inspection, and 5 points if image switching is not seamless. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the data updates immediately when compression settings change and if values are properly formatted (KB/MB with appropriate decimal places).

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to image compression (e.g., unrelated social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations slowing down the interface).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if WebWorkers aren't used for heavy compression tasks to prevent UI freezing.
