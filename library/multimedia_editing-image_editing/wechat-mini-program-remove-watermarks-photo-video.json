  "question": "You are a coding expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you provide is executable and functional. I am a programming beginner, and I want you to help me create a WeChat Mini Program for removing watermarks from platforms like TikTok, Kuaishou, Xiaohongshu, etc. The app should be able to remove watermarks from both photo collections and videos. I am using WeChat Developer Tools. Please tell me which folders to import files into and what code to add to each file. I will send you a rough sketch of the design.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements watermark detection algorithms (using techniques like contour detection, frequency domain filtering, or machine learning models) and properly removes watermarks without degrading original content quality. Score 0 if no implementation, 5 if basic removal for only one platform, and 10 if comprehensive removal for multiple platforms (TikTok, Kuaishou, Xiaohongshu) is implemented.",

Check if the implementation uses WeChat Mini Program's native APIs correctly for media processing. Deduct 5 points if video processing is missing, 3 points if photo collection processing is incomplete, and 2 points if format conversion is not handled properly. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to watermark removal (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
