Please implement an online image clipboard tool where users can upload images, cut out specified areas, and save the cropped portions as new images. The tool should support freely selecting the size and position of the crop area, and provide real-time preview of the cropping effect.",

Verify proper error handling for invalid file types and oversized images. Deduct 5 points if only basic file input is implemented without drag-and-drop, 3 points if image format validation is missing, and 2 points if there's no proper upload feedback.

Check if it provides visual guides (rule of thirds, golden ratio), aspect ratio constraints, and handles edge cases like small images. Score 0 if cropping functionality isn't implemented, 5 if only basic selection is available, and 10 if it includes advanced features like maintaining aspect ratios and intuitive resizing handles on all corners and edges.

The preview should accurately represent the final output. Score 0 if no preview exists, 5 if preview is present but not real-time or has significant lag, and 10 if preview updates instantly and accurately reflects the final output including any applied transformations.

Function modules unrelated to image cropping (e.g., a built-in music player) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the interface).
