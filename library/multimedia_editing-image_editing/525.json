  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate, expert responses. Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration purposes. Develop a front-end project with image text annotation functionality. After users upload an image, they should be able to input text at specified positions on the image, with options to set font, color, and size. When the input is complete, users should be able to save the image with the added text to their local device.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly handles image file upload through HTML file input, includes proper file type validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP), file size limitations, and displays the uploaded image with proper scaling and positioning on canvas or similar element. Score 0 if basic upload is not working, 5 if only basic upload without validation is implemented, and 10 if complete upload with validation, preview, and error handling is included.",

Must include visual indicators for text placement, input field positioning, and coordinate transformation handling for different image scales. Deduct 5 points if coordinate mapping is inaccurate, and 3 points if visual feedback for positioning is missing. Full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for each missing styling option, 5 points if real-time preview is not implemented. Check for proper styling persistence and rendering accuracy. Full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if text rendering quality is poor, 3 points if original image resolution is not preserved, and 5 points if download mechanism fails.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to image annotation (e.g., built-in image filters unrelated to text overlay) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., complex animations during text input).
