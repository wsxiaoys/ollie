Create a video screenshot tool that allows users to upload videos and select screenshot points on a timeline. After taking screenshots, users should be able to perform simple edits (such as cropping, adding text) and export the screenshots as image files.",

Check for error handling during uploads (file size limits, format restrictions). Score 0 if video upload/playback is not implemented, 5 if only basic functionality works, and 10 if it includes advanced features like buffering indicators and adaptive playback quality.",

Check if the timeline shows proper video duration, allows precise seeking, and provides visual feedback when screenshot points are selected. Deduct 5 points if the timeline lacks proper time markers, 3 points if screenshot preview is missing, and 3 points if the selected frame differs from the actual screenshot.

Check if the cropping tool provides proper handles and aspect ratio options, and if text editing includes font selection, size adjustment, and positioning. Deduct 5 points if cropping functionality is buggy, 3 points if text positioning is imprecise, and 2 points if undo/redo functionality is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to video screenshot (e.g., a built-in music player) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or filters that slow down the interface).
