      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements file upload through HTML input elements and JavaScript, including drag-and-drop support, file type validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP), file size limits, and preview functionality. Score 0 if basic upload is not working, 5 if only basic file selection works without validation, and 10 if all upload features including drag-and-drop, validation, and preview are fully implemented.",

      "description": "Check whether the image processing uses Canvas API or WebGL for clarity enhancement algorithms such as sharpening filters, contrast adjustment, brightness optimization, or noise reduction. Evaluate if the processing maintains image quality without artifacts. Deduct 5 points if only basic filters are applied, 3 points if processing causes visible artifacts or quality loss. Full score requires advanced enhancement algorithms with quality preservation.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the save functionality supports multiple formats (PNG, JPEG with quality settings), maintains original resolution, and provides download links or automatic download triggers. Check if the saved file preserves the enhanced quality. Deduct 5 points if only one format is supported, 3 points if quality is degraded during save, and 2 points if filename handling is poor. Full implementation should include format options and quality settings.",

Deduct 5 points if comparison view is missing, 3 points if no progress indication, and 2 points if batch processing is not supported. Give 10 points if the complete workflow with all features is implemented.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to image processing (e.g., built-in games or social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during processing). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or no separation of concerns; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if no proper async/await handling for file operations.
