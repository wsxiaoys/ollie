Score 0 if the core drawing functionality is missing, 5 if only basic tools are implemented, and 10 if comprehensive drawing features with proper event handling are included.",

Deduct 3 points if only basic transformations exist, 5 points if filters are missing, and 7 points if no image adjustments are available. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the implementation uses browser storage APIs appropriately. Deduct 10 points if any core functionality requires authentication, 5 points if local storage is not utilized for preserving work.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to image creation (e.g., a news feed) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the drawing experience). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not optimized for performance.
