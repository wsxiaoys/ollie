      "description": "Review whether the code includes the essential WeChat Mini Program files (app.js, app.json, app.wxss) and page structure (WXML, WXSS, JS). Check if the project configuration is properly set up with required permissions for image access. Score 0 if the basic structure is missing, 5 if partially implemented, 10 if complete with proper configuration and permissions.",

Check for proper handling of file types (jpg, png, etc.), image size limits, and preview functionality. Deduct 3 points if only basic import works without validation, 5 points if there's no error handling for failed imports or oversized images. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Analyze whether the code implements a proper pixelation algorithm (e.g., canvas-based sampling, color quantization) rather than simple resizing. Check if the pixel density/resolution is configurable. Deduct 5 points if the algorithm produces low-quality results, 3 points if performance is poor for larger images. Score 10 if it includes advanced features like color palette customization or dithering options.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the pixel art generator (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
