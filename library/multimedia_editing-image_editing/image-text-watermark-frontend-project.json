  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Create a frontend project for adding text watermarks to images. After users upload an image, they can input the text they want to add, select the text color, font size, and position on the page. When they click the \"Add Watermark\" button, the image will display with the watermark effect. Users should be able to save the watermarked image.",

Check if the uploaded image is correctly rendered on the canvas before watermark application.

Verify that text rendering maintains quality at different sizes, preserves transparency settings, and implements proper positioning according to user selection (9-point grid or free positioning).
