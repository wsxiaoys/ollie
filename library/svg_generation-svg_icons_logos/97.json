Please help me implement the following requirement using code, specifically using SVG code: create a visual representation of downloading files from a folder on a computer by clicking on an arrow within a circle.",

      "description": "Check if the SVG includes the essential elements: a folder icon/representation, files, a circular arrow button, and clear visual relation between these elements. Score 0 if core elements are missing, 5 if they're present but not properly connected visually, and 10 if all elements form a coherent download visualization.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the SVG includes JavaScript event handlers that respond to user clicks on the circular arrow. The interaction should trigger a visual indication of downloading (animation, state change, etc.). Deduct 5 points if click events aren't implemented, 3 points if visual feedback is missing. Full score requires both interaction and proper feedback.",

Check for SMIL animations or JavaScript-based animations with proper easing functions and timing. Award 10 points for fluid animations with proper stages (start, progress, completion), 5 points for basic animations, 0 if no animation exists.",

      "description": "Check if the visualization provides clear feedback on download status (starting, in-progress, completed). This could be through progress indicators, color changes, or other visual cues. Deduct 5 points if status indication is unclear, 7 points if completely missing. Full score requires comprehensive status visualization.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid repeated clicks, browser compatibility issues, etc.) and provide friendly error handling or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

File size visualization during download). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple animation systems doing the same task) 2. Function modules unrelated to the download visualization (e.g., unrelated icons or decorations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global namespace pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if inline styles are heavily used instead of CSS classes.

Deduct 3 points for each poorly designed visual element, 5 points for jarring color combinations, and 5 points for inconsistent styling between elements. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for jerky or stuttering animations, and 5 points for confusing interactive elements. The full score is 10 points.",
