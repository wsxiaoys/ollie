      "title": "Is the SVG binoculars structure accurately implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements the binoculars structure using SVG elements, including dual circular lenses, central bridge connection, eyepieces, and adjustment mechanism. Score 0 if basic binoculars shape is not recognizable, 5 if only basic circular lenses are implemented, and 10 if complete binoculars structure with all components (lenses, bridge, eyepieces, focusing ring details) is fully rendered.",

      "description": "Check whether the code includes interactive browsing (pan/drag), search functionality (target highlighting/scanning animation), and magnification effects (zoom in/out with visual feedback). Deduct 5 points if magnification lacks smooth transition, 3 points if search function has no visual indicators. Two-way interaction between user input and visual response is required.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG uses efficient path optimization, proper viewBox configuration, and responsive scaling. Check if vector graphics maintain crisp edges at different zoom levels and use appropriate coordinate systems. Deduct 5 points if pixelation occurs during scaling, 3 points if SVG file size exceeds 50KB without justification. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases and cross-browser compatibility, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Over-complex animations that don't serve the core functionality. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core binoculars functionality is interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if inline styles dominate over CSS classes; deduct 5 points if JavaScript lacks proper event handling or uses deprecated methods; deduct 5 points if SVG structure is not semantic or accessible.
