      "description": "Review whether the SVG code accurately represents the Snapple logo's distinctive shape, proportions, and font styling. The logo should include the characteristic oval/rounded rectangle shape with the Snapple text rendered in the correct typeface. Score 0 if the logo is unrecognizable as Snapple, 5 if it has major proportion issues or incorrect font styling, and 10 if it faithfully recreates the logo.",

Check if the logo uses appropriate fill and stroke attributes with proper contrast between elements. Deduct 5 points if any colors other than black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF) are used, and 3 points if contrast issues make parts of the logo difficult to distinguish. Full score is 10 points.",

The hat should appear to be sitting on the logo rather than floating or awkwardly placed. Deduct 5 points if the hat's position is unnatural, 3 points if its size is disproportionate, and 5 points if its style clashes with the logo design. Full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if the code avoids unnecessary complexity, excessive nodes, or redundant path data.

Check if the code includes comments for complex sections and uses id/class attributes logically. Score 10 points for fully responsive SVG with appropriate fallbacks, 5 points if it works but lacks adaptability features, and 0 points if it breaks at different sizes or in different browsers.",

Excessive detail that doesn't contribute to the recognizability of the logo at normal viewing sizes. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if redundancies significantly increase file size or rendering complexity.",
