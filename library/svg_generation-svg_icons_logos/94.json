      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code correctly reproduces the Amazon logo with its distinctive curved arrow from 'a' to 'z' (representing that Amazon sells everything from A to Z) and the trademark smile. Check if the proportions match the official logo (roughly 2.55:1 width to height ratio). Deduct 5 points if the curved arrow is missing or inaccurate, 5 points if the smile is incorrect, and 3 points if the text is not properly rendered. Score 0 if the logo is unrecognizable as Amazon, 5 if it's recognizable but with significant inaccuracies, and 10 if it closely matches the official logo.",

Amazon's logo should use smooth BÃ©zier curves for the smile/arrow. Evaluate if the implementation avoids redundant nodes and uses proper grouping of elements. Deduct 5 points if path data is overly complex or inefficient, 3 points if inappropriate SVG elements are used, and 2 points if there's no grouping of related elements. The full score is 10 points.",
