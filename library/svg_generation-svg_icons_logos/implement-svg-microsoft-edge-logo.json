      "description": "Check if the SVG element has appropriate viewport dimensions, viewBox attribute, and proper namespace declarations. Verify that the basic structural elements needed for the Edge logo (the circular wave/swirl shape) are present. Score 0 if the SVG structure is missing or fundamentally incorrect, 5 if basic structure exists but with significant errors, and 10 if properly implemented with correct attributes and structure.",

Check for proper curvature of the wave elements. Deduct 3 points for minor shape inaccuracies, 5 points for significant shape distortions, and 7 points if the logo resembles an outdated version.

Check for optimization techniques like path simplification, appropriate precision in coordinates (not excessive decimal places), and minimal use of redundant elements.

Code with strong robustness should include fallback options or handle edge cases. Give 10 points for implementation with cross-browser compatibility considerations and proper error handling, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if obvious compatibility issues exist.",

Unnecessary nested groups or transforms that complicate the structure 3. Excessive styling that could be simplified.
