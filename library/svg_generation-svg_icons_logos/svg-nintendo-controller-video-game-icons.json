      "description": "Review whether the SVG code accurately recreates the Nintendo controller's iconic structure through proper geometric shapes and proportions. Check if it includes essential elements like D-pad, action buttons (A/B), shoulder buttons, analog sticks, and the characteristic controller body shape. Score 0 if only basic rectangles are used, 5 if controller outline is recognizable but lacks detail, and 10 if all controller components are accurately proportioned and positioned according to authentic Nintendo controller design.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the gaming icons (characters, items, UI elements) are implemented with clean SVG paths and demonstrate gaming aesthetics. Check for proper use of vector graphics principles, scalable design, and gaming-themed iconography. Icons should be instantly recognizable and maintain visual consistency. Deduct 5 points if icons are poorly vectorized or pixelated, deduct 3 points if gaming theme is not clearly conveyed. Full score requires professional-grade gaming iconography.",

      "description": "Assess whether the implementation successfully creates an engaging minimal entertainment experience through interactive elements or visual storytelling. Check if the controller and icons work together to suggest or enable actual gaming interaction. The design should communicate 'playfulness' and 'entertainment' immediately. Deduct 5 points if no interactive elements are present, deduct 3 points if the entertainment aspect is unclear or confusing.",

      "description": "Review the SVG code structure for proper use of groups, layers, and semantic organization. Check if the code uses appropriate SVG elements (rect, circle, path, polygon) efficiently and includes proper viewBox settings for scalability. Evaluate whether the code is clean, readable, and follows SVG best practices. Deduct 5 points if excessive nested groups are used, deduct 3 points if viewBox is incorrectly set, deduct 5 points if inline styles are used instead of proper SVG attributes.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as browser compatibility issues, scaling problems, rendering errors) and provide fallback mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should work consistently across different browsers and screen sizes, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no compatibility considerations are made, give 0 points.",

Interactive SVG elements that respond to clicks 4. Creative use of SVG filters or gradients). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Unnecessary styling that doesn't contribute to the gaming theme. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core visual concept is obscured by redundant code.",
