      "description": "Check if the SVG code properly renders a recognizable Nintendo controller with accurate proportions, buttons (D-pad, A/B buttons, Start/Select), and characteristic shape. Score 0 if the controller is unrecognizable, 5 if basic shape is present but details are missing, and 10 if the controller is detailed and visually accurate.",

Deduct 5 points if icons don't change by hour programmatically, 3 points if fewer than 4 different icons are implemented. Give full points if at least 8 distinct icons are available with hour-based logic.",

The implementation should handle all 24 hours appropriately and update without requiring page refresh. Deduct 5 points if static time is used, 3 points if the hour detection has bugs. Full points require accurate time detection with smooth transitions.",
