      "description": "Check if the plug has the correct proportions, prongs, and structural elements typical of an electrical plug. The SVG should use appropriate path elements with precise coordinates. Score 0 if the plug is missing, 5 if basic shape is present but inaccurate, and 10 if the plug is detailed and recognizable.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the charger is correctly connected to the plug and has appropriate details (adapter body, cable connection points). The SVG implementation should use proper grouping (<g> elements) for related components. Deduct 5 points if the charger lacks distinctive features, 3 points if connection to the plug is unclear. Give 10 points for a well-detailed, recognizable charger.",

The SVG paths should use appropriate curves and lines to create a realistic speaker shape. Score 0 if the speaker is missing, 5 if only basic outline is present, and 10 if the speaker is detailed and identifiable.",

The cord should have consistent thickness and natural bending. Deduct 5 points if the cord uses only straight lines, 3 points if the connections to devices are imprecise. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code is properly structured with viewBox attribute, appropriate dimensions, and organized elements. Check if the code handles scaling appropriately and maintains aspect ratio. Code with strong robustness should use relative units rather than absolute pixel values. Give 10 points for robust implementation, 5 points for average implementation with minor issues, and 0 points for poor implementation.",

Creative use of gradients or patterns to enhance visual appeal). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Excessive detail that complicates the SVG without adding clarity. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core design is obscured by redundant elements.",

Deduct 5 points if elements lack meaningful ids or classes; deduct 5 points if the code is unnecessarily verbose or unoptimized; deduct 5 points if there's no consideration for accessibility (missing title/desc elements).

Deduct 3 points for inconsistent line weights, 5 points for poor balance between elements, and 5 points for lack of clarity when scaled down. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for poor contrast making elements hard to distinguish, 3 points for inconsistent use of fills vs. strokes, and 5 points for missed opportunities to use negative space effectively.
