      "description": "Check whether the code correctly implements API calls to the DeepSeek model, including proper request formatting, response handling, and error management. Score 0 if no API connection is implemented, 5 if basic connectivity exists but lacks error handling, and 10 if comprehensive API integration with proper timeout handling, retries, and error states is included.",

Check for input validation, support for different query types (text completion, question answering, etc.), and proper display of model outputs with appropriate formatting. Deduct 3 points if only basic text input/output is supported without formatting options, 5 points if there's no way to customize model parameters, and 2 points if response streaming is not implemented.

Evaluate whether loading indicators are present during model processing, whether timeouts are handled gracefully, and if users can cancel ongoing requests. Deduct 5 points if no loading indicators exist, 3 points if request cancellation is not possible, and 2 points if error states are not properly communicated. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if previous exchanges are displayed, if context is preserved between requests, and if users can review or reference past interactions. Deduct 5 points if no history is maintained, 3 points if history exists but cannot be managed (cleared/exported), and 2 points if context between messages is not preserved.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the DeepSeek model interaction (e.g., unrelated analytics) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow down the interface). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation between presentation and business logic.
