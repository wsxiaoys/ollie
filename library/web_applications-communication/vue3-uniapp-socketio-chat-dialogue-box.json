      "description": "Evaluate the component architecture for the chat dialogue box. Check if it uses Vue3 composition API effectively with proper reactive data, computed properties, and lifecycle hooks. Verify separation of concerns (UI components, data handling, socket connection management). Deduct 5 points if still using Vue2 patterns, 3 points if composition API is poorly implemented, and 3 points if reactive references are misused. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for conditional platform-specific code, proper usage of uni-app UI components, and responsive layouts that work across mobile/desktop. Verify if platform-specific edge cases are handled (iOS safe areas, Android back button). Deduct 5 points if only works on one platform, 3 points if missing key platform adaptations.

Verify presence of connection management (connect, disconnect, reconnect), proper event handling, typing indicators, read receipts, and error handling. Check for disconnection resilience with message queue/local storage.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to couple communication (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that cause lag).
