Check if videos are properly loaded, played, and swapped as the user scrolls. Score 0 if implementation is missing, 5 if basic scrolling works but has noticeable gaps, and 10 if the infinite scroll is seamless like TikTok's.",

Check if videos preload correctly to avoid buffering during scrolling. Deduct 5 points if videos don't autoplay/pause appropriately, and 3 points if basic controls are missing or non-functional.
