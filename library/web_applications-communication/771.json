Check for appropriate semantic tags (header, main, form, etc.) and a logical DOM hierarchy. Score 0 if the basic two-column layout is missing, 5 if the layout exists but has structural issues, and 10 for a clean, semantic implementation.",

Check for media queries that transform the side-by-side layout to a stacked layout on smaller screens. Score 0 if no responsive features exist, 5 if basic responsiveness is implemented but with breakpoint issues, and 10 for a fully fluid responsive design with appropriate breakpoints (typically 768px, 992px, 1200px).",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
