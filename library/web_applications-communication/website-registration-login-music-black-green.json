Score 0 if basic form submission is missing, 5 if only client-side validation exists without server integration, and 10 if the system includes secure password storage (hashing), proper session management, and database connectivity.",

Deduct 3 points if the code is too simple (e.g., static or predictable), 3 points if there's no server-side validation, and 4 points if there's no expiration mechanism. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core requirements (e.g., unnecessary social media integrations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations that slow page loading).
