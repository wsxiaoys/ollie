Deduct 5 points if Options API is used instead of Composition API; deduct 3 points if lifecycle hooks are improperly utilized; deduct 5 points if reactive state management is not implemented.

Function modules unrelated to viewer count tracking 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that impact data refresh rates).
