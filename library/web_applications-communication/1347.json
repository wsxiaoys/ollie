Check if it includes typing speed control, cursor blinking effect, and proper text rendering. Score 0 if the stream printing effect is not implemented at all, 5 if only basic character-by-character printing is present, and 10 if it includes advanced features like variable typing speed based on content or punctuation pauses.",

Verify if the code utilizes proper uni-app components (like <view>, <text>), lifecycle hooks, and properly handles cross-platform compatibility issues. Deduct 3 points if platform-specific code is not properly conditioned, 3 points if non-standard HTML/CSS is used instead of uni-app components, and 5 points if the implementation doesn't follow uni-app's reactivity system.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to dialogue streaming (e.g., unnecessary third-party libraries) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that interfere with readability).
