Check for appropriate use of Vue 3 composition API or Vue 2 options API, single-file component structure, and proper separation of template, script, and style sections. Verify if props, emits, and component registration are correctly implemented. Score 0 if the Vue component structure is missing or completely incorrect, 5 if basic structure exists but with significant issues, and 10 if fully compliant with Vue best practices.",
