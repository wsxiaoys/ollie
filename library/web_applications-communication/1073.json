I've deleted all the previous code, and now I'm restating my requirements. Based on the previous code, please provide the complete code. On the personal homepage, first design a login button. When the login button is clicked, prompt for user information authorization. After the user authorizes, display \"Already logged in\" or \"Registration successful.\" At this point, after successful login, the page displays the user's nickname as \"WeChat User,\" and add this user's information to the user data table, mainly the user_id, which can be retrieved based on the user's login status on other pages.",

It should use standard CSS design patterns (hover/active states) and be accessible. Score 0 if the button is missing, 5 if it exists but lacks proper styling or interaction states, and 10 if fully implemented with all visual feedback states.",
