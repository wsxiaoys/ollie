Check for proper use of setup(), ref(), reactive(), and other Vue 3 specific features. Score 0 if Vue 3 is not implemented correctly, 5 if basic Vue 3 structure exists but lacks optimization, and 10 if it fully utilizes Vue 3's capabilities including proper component hierarchy, lifecycle hooks, and performance optimizations.",

Check if the server handles errors appropriately and implements proper API versioning.

Evaluate the 'user' table schema design for appropriate fields, data types, indexes, and constraints. Look for proper SQL query construction with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

Check for form validation, API error handling, and graceful degradation. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to a social media platform like Xiaohongshu 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow loading).
