      "description": "Check if the code implements the fundamental secret mailbox features including message encryption, secure storage, and retrieval mechanisms. Score 0 if encryption is missing, 5 if only basic encryption without proper key management is implemented, and 10 if end-to-end encryption with secure key exchange is fully implemented.",

Deduct 5 points if password storage is insecure, 3 points if 2FA is missing, and 3 points if there's no account recovery mechanism.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Location-based or time-based access restrictions). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to secure messaging (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that compromise security or performance. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
