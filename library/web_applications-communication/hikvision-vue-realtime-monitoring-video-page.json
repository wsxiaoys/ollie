      "description": "Review whether the code correctly integrates Hikvision Web SDK according to the official PDF documentation, including proper initialization of video plugins, camera connection establishment, and stream decoding capabilities. Check if the implementation handles different video formats (H.264/H.265) and supports multiple resolution options. Score 0 if SDK is not properly integrated, 5 if basic video display works but lacks format support, and 10 if all streaming protocols and formats are fully supported with proper error handling.",

Check if the system supports multiple concurrent video streams and handles stream switching seamlessly. Deduct 5 points if latency exceeds 1 second, deduct 3 points if buffer overflow occurs during network fluctuations. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the Vue.js implementation follows best practices with proper component separation (video player, control panel, device management), state management using Vuex/Pinia, and reactive data binding for real-time status updates. Evaluate if the component lifecycle methods properly handle video resource allocation and cleanup. Deduct 5 points if components are tightly coupled, deduct 3 points if memory leaks occur during component destruction. Award 10 points for clean modular architecture.",

Check if the interface provides intuitive controls for brightness/contrast adjustment and supports preset position management.

Code with strong robustness should implement automatic reconnection, graceful degradation, and clear error messaging, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to video monitoring (e.g., built-in chat system) 3. Heavy visual effects that impact video performance (e.g., complex CSS animations during streaming).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or Vue composition API is not properly utilized; deduct 5 points if bundle size is not optimized for video streaming; deduct 5 points if no proper testing setup for video components.
