      "description": "Review whether the Vue components accurately reproduce WeChat's chat interface layout, including message list, input area, header navigation, and contact list. Check if the message bubble design matches WeChat's visual style (left/right alignment, different colors for sent/received messages, timestamps, read status indicators). Score 0 if basic chat interface is missing, 5 if only simple message display is implemented, and 10 if all WeChat-style interface elements are fully included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether Vue's reactive data binding correctly handles real-time message updates, message sending/receiving animations, scroll-to-bottom behavior, and message status changes. Check if Vue lifecycle hooks are properly used for component mounting and data initialization. Deduct 5 points if message list doesn't auto-scroll, and 3 points if Vue reactivity issues cause UI lag.

Evaluate if the data structure supports different message types (text, images, emojis, voice messages).

Check if typing indicators, message read receipts, and contact online status are implemented. Deduct 5 points if emoji support is missing, and 3 points if no multimedia message handling exists.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like message sending failures and component lifecycle issues, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Message encryption simulation 4. Group chat avatars 5. Voice-to-text conversion mock). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to WeChat chat (e.g., built-in games or shopping features) 3. Overly complex animations that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects on message sending). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core chat functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or Vue patterns are misused; deduct 5 points if component coupling is too high; deduct 5 points if no proper component hierarchy exists.

Deduct 3 points for each visual inconsistency with WeChat's design, 5 points for incorrect color usage, and 5 points for poor layout resemblance. The full score is 10 points.",
