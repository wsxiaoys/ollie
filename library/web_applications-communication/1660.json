Validate that form fields include proper input validation (email format, password strength, etc.). Score 0 if core functionality is missing, 5 if only basic form submission is implemented without validation, and 10 if both login and registration forms are complete with comprehensive validation.",

Evaluate whether the state management handles the transition properly, preserving data when appropriate.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to login/registration (e.g., unnecessary animations or widgets) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or heavy background effects).
