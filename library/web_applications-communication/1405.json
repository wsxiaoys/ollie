      "description": "Review whether the code correctly uses Vue3 Composition API features including setup(), ref/reactive state management, computed properties, and lifecycle hooks. Check if the component structure follows Vue3 best practices with proper template syntax, event handling, and form binding. Score 0 if using Options API or Vue2 syntax, 5 if basic Composition API is used but lacks proper reactivity patterns, and 10 if fully leveraging Vue3's advanced features with proper TypeScript support.",

Check if the authentication state is properly managed with user data, login status, and token storage. Verify if store actions handle async operations correctly with proper error handling. Deduct 5 points if store mutations are used instead of actions, 3 points if state persistence is not implemented, and 2 points if store modularity is poor. Full score is 10 points.",

Verify if JWT token validation, expiration handling, and logout token cleanup are implemented. Deduct 5 points if tokens are stored in plain localStorage without encryption, 3 points if no refresh token mechanism exists, and 5 points if no token expiration validation is present.

Check if user-friendly error messages are displayed and proper fallback mechanisms exist. Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle edge cases like concurrent login attempts and session conflicts, giving 10 points.

Over-engineered validation that impacts performance 4. Redundant API calls or excessive state watchers.
