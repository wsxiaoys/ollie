      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements the core data structures for a message board: message objects (with timestamps, user IDs, content), user profiles, and threading/reply relationships. Score 0 if no data structure is defined, 5 if only basic message objects are created, and 10 if a complete relational structure including replies, likes, and metadata is implemented.",

Deduct 3 points for each missing operation. Proper validation and error handling for each operation should be present. The full score is 10 points.",

Is there proper data sanitization to prevent injection attacks? Deduct 5 points if data is only stored in memory without persistence, and 3 points if there's no data validation or sanitization.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to a message board (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or visual effects). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no error handling or logging.
