Check if the QR code generation uses a reliable library and if the generated code scales without degradation.

Verify that messages appear instantly for all users without manual refresh and that the connection handles disconnections gracefully.

Function modules unrelated to chat (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down messaging).
