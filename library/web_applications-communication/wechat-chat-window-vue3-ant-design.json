Verify that the package.json includes the correct dependencies (ant-design-vue, vue@3.x).

It should include at least: a container component, message list component, and individual message components with proper differentiation between sent and received messages.

Function modules unrelated to chat display (e.g., unnecessary animations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., complex transitions for every message).
