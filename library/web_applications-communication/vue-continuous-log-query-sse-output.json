Deduct 5 points if reconnection is not implemented, 3 points if event type filtering is missing.

Check if logs are properly formatted with timestamps, log levels, and message content. Deduct 3 points if logs aren't visually distinguished by severity level, 5 points if the component doesn't handle large log volumes efficiently. Full score requires proper data binding, reactivity, and optimized rendering.",

Check if filters are applied reactively without interrupting the SSE connection. Deduct 3 points for each missing core filter type (severity, time, text search), 5 points if filtering disrupts the SSE connection. Full marks require debounced search, highlighted matches, and preserved filter state.",

Check for graceful handling of server disconnections, network failures, and reconnection attempts with exponential backoff. Deduct 5 points if error states aren't communicated to users, 3 points if reconnection doesn't use backoff strategy. Full score requires comprehensive state management and user notifications.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to log viewing (e.g., unnecessary dashboards) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
