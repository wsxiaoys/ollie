      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements all essential UI elements of a typical WeChat personal center (profile avatar, nickname, WeChat ID, moments section, wallet, settings, etc.). Check if the layout properly adapts to various screen sizes using responsive design techniques. Score 0 if core UI components are missing, 5 if basic components are present but lack polish, and 10 if the implementation is complete and faithful to WeChat's design language.",

Check for platform-specific conditional rendering, use of adaptive frameworks (like Flutter, React Native, or WeChat Mini Program framework), and appropriate handling of different device capabilities. Deduct 3 points if any major platform is not properly supported, 5 points if platform-specific features are ignored, and give 10 points only if the solution elegantly handles all target platforms.",

Verify if CI/CD pipeline scripts are provided with platform-specific signing processes. Deduct 3 points for each missing platform build configuration, and 5 points if the release process lacks security considerations.

Check for graceful error handling, fallback mechanisms, and proper state management. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to personal center (e.g., a full chat implementation) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations).
