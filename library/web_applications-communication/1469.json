  "question": "You are a coding expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you provide is executable for demonstration purposes. I now want to create a user live streaming viewing page. The backend uses HLS to send the streaming content, and Socket.io to transmit real-time information during the broadcast. For the entire page, I would like to have a viewing area, a danmaku (bullet comment) area, and user information in the top right corner.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code correctly implements HLS streaming using appropriate libraries (hls.js, video.js, etc.). Check for essential features like adaptive bitrate switching, buffer management, and error recovery. Score 0 if streaming is not implemented, 5 if only basic playback works, and 10 if it includes quality selection, automatic fallback mechanisms, and proper event handling.",

Verify whether proper namespaces/rooms are used for efficient message routing, and if acknowledgments are used for critical operations. Deduct 5 points if reconnection logic is missing, and 3 points if there's no error handling for socket events. Full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if comments overlap excessively, 3 points if there's no performance optimization for large volume of comments, and 2 points if customization options are missing.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to streaming (e.g., unnecessary social media widgets) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that impact streaming performance).
