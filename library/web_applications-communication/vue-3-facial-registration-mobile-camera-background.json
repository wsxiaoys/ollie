      "description": "Check if the code correctly implements face detection using appropriate APIs (like Face API JS or OpenCV.js) and captures facial landmarks for registration. The system should detect faces in real-time through the mobile camera feed and validate that a proper face is present before allowing registration. Score 0 if face detection is not implemented, 5 if basic detection without landmarks is implemented, and 10 if full facial feature extraction is properly configured.",

Check if the camera selection works for both front and back cameras and adjusts resolution based on device capabilities. Deduct 5 points if permission handling is missing, 3 points if device orientation changes aren't handled, and 2 points if there's no fallback for browsers with limited support.",

Check if the system handles edge detection around the face for natural blending and provides options for different backgrounds. Deduct 5 points if the background appears with jagged edges, 3 points if performance issues occur on mobile devices, and 2 points if background customization options are limited.",

Check if components are well-structured with clear separation of concerns. Deduct 5 points for using Options API instead of Composition API, 3 points for improper ref/reactive usage, and 5 points for component logic that should be extracted into composables.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to facial registration (e.g., unnecessary animations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance on mobile devices.
