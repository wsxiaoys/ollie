      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements user registration functionality including form validation, secure password handling (hashing/salting), and proper error handling. Check if email verification is included, and if the registration flow prevents common security issues (SQL injection, XSS). Score 0 if registration logic is missing, 5 if basic registration exists but with security flaws, and 10 if a complete secure registration system is implemented with proper validation.",

Check if the solution uses WebSockets or a similar real-time protocol, handles message formatting/sanitization, and includes typing indicators. Deduct 5 points if messages aren't persistent, 3 points if real-time updates are missing, and 2 points if user presence tracking is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the code uses modern module loading techniques (e.g., import(), RequireJS, webpack code splitting), handles loading states properly, and includes error recovery for module loading failures. Deduct 5 points if loading states aren't handled, 5 points if error conditions aren't managed gracefully, and 3 points if module dependencies aren't correctly managed. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate consistent coding style, proper indentation, meaningful variable/function names, and appropriate comments. Check if CSS is organized (using a methodology like BEM, SMACSS, or CSS-in-JS), and if the UI components follow a consistent design language. Deduct 3 points for inconsistent styling, 3 points for poor code organization, and 4 points for inadequate documentation. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to registration or chat (e.g., unnecessary analytics) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
