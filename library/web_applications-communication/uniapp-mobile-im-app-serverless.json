Score 0 if no P2P implementation exists, 5 if basic connectivity is established but unstable, and 10 if robust connectivity with reconnection handling is implemented.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to messaging (e.g., built-in games not using the P2P framework) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance on mobile devices (e.g., excessive animations).
