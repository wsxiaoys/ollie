      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements file chunking on the client side, including proper slice calculation, chunk size management, and unique identifiers for each chunk. Score 0 if chunking is not implemented, 5 if basic chunking exists but with limitations (e.g., fixed chunk size that doesn't account for file size), and 10 if it implements adaptive chunking with proper error handling.",

Deduct 3 points if progress indication is missing, 3 points if there's no pause/resume capability, and 4 points if error states aren't displayed to users. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if chunk verification is missing, 3 points if temporary files aren't properly managed, and 5 points if the final assembly process doesn't handle edge cases.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to file uploading (e.g., unnecessary authentication layers) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if logging and debugging capabilities are insufficient.
