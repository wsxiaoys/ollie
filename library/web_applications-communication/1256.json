Help me write a \"SDU COMPUEX Shandong University Digital Technology Club Activity Record Sheet\" for a \"Network Repair System Development\" project. The background is Shandong University. The Network Repair System Development is based on Python FastAPI+Vue3, supporting repair requests from multiple campuses, with real-time responses and email notifications.",

      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements RESTful API endpoints using FastAPI, including authentication, error handling, and middleware for cross-campus repair requests. Check if proper dependency injection, request validation, and response models are implemented. Score 0 if core API endpoints are missing, 5 if basic endpoints are implemented but lack proper validation/error handling, and 10 if the implementation is complete with documentation.",

Deduct 3 points if responsive design is missing, 3 points if component reusability is poor, and 4 points if proper form validation is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the system implements WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time status updates, and verify if the email notification system uses proper templates and error handling. Deduct 5 points if the notification system doesn't handle connection drops, 3 points if email templates are hardcoded without variables, and 2 points if notification preferences aren't configurable.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to network repair (e.g., a built-in weather widget) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
