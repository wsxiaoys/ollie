Check for platform-specific conditionals using platform detection methods like uni.getSystemInfoSync().platform or process.env.VUE_APP_PLATFORM. Score 0 if the code doesn't follow uniapp specifications, 5 if it supports only some platforms, and 10 if it properly implements and optimizes for all required platforms.",

Function modules unrelated to wallpaper display (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
