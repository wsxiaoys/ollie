Verify CSS positioning (fixed position, z-index handling), responsive design across different screen sizes, and proper state handling (minimized/expanded). Deduct 3 points if the button isn't properly positioned, 5 points if it's not responsive, and 3 points if state transitions aren't smooth. The full score is 10 points.",

Messages should properly scroll and stack, with clear visual distinction between sent and received messages.
