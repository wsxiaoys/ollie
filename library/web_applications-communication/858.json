      "title": "Is the Vue login component properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the login component includes proper form validation, password masking, error handling for authentication failures, and controlled inputs. Check for v-model usage, form submission prevention, and validation feedback. Score 0 if core login functionality is missing, 5 if basic functionality exists without validation, and 10 if comprehensive validation and security features are implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate the authentication implementation including token storage (preferably using HttpOnly cookies or secure localStorage), CSRF protection, proper handling of authentication errors, and timeout/refresh mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if tokens are stored insecurely, 3 points if no token expiration handling exists, and 3 points if authentication state is not properly maintained across page reloads.

      "description": "Check if the navigation component adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop), handles active route highlighting, and includes responsive collapse/expand functionality. Evaluate Vue Router integration, navigation guards for protected routes, and route transitions. Deduct 3 points for each missing responsiveness feature, 5 points if route guards aren't implemented, and 3 points if navigation state isn't preserved. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether Vuex (or Pinia) is correctly integrated for state management, with proper separation of concerns (mutations, actions, getters), namespaced modules for auth and navigation, and consistent state access patterns. Deduct 5 points for direct state mutations, 3 points for inadequate error handling in actions, and 5 points if authentication state is not properly maintained in the store.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as network errors during login, invalid inputs, token expiration, unauthorized access attempts, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Customizable navigation themes/layouts 4. Animated route transitions). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to login/navigation (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or transitions). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if proper Vue lifecycle hooks aren't used appropriately.
