      "description": "Verify if the code implements WebRTC peer connection setup, including SDP offer/answer exchange and ICE candidate handling. Check if video/audio tracks are properly captured and added to peer connections. Score 0 if basic WebRTC connectivity isn't implemented, 5 if only one-way communication works, and 10 if full bidirectional audio/video streaming is functional with proper media constraints.",

Check if event listeners for 'connect', 'disconnect', and custom signaling events are implemented. Verify error handling for connection failures and reconnection logic.

Check for conditional compilation (#ifdef APP-PLUS) and platform detection. Verify if the app properly falls back when certain features are unavailable on specific platforms.

Feature implementations unrelated to video chat (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Heavy visual effects that degrade performance (e.g., complex animations during calls).

Check for memory leak prevention, especially regarding WebRTC objects and event listeners.
