      "description": "Review whether the React component accurately implements real-time search filtering, keyboard navigation (up/down arrows, Enter to select, Escape to close), and click selection. The component should handle input changes with proper debouncing (200-300ms) and display filtered results dynamically. Score 0 if basic autocomplete logic is missing, 5 if only basic filtering works, and 10 if all core interactions including keyboard navigation are fully functional.",

Evaluate if large datasets are handled efficiently without UI blocking. Deduct 5 points if no debouncing is implemented, 3 points if unnecessary re-renders occur, and 2 points if filtering algorithm is inefficient. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper cleanup of event listeners and timers. The component should handle edge cases like empty results, loading states, and error handling. Deduct 5 points if state management is chaotic, 3 points if memory leaks exist due to improper cleanup. Full score is 10 points.",

The component should be keyboard-navigable and provide clear focus indicators. Deduct 5 points if ARIA attributes are missing, 3 points if keyboard navigation is incomplete, and 2 points if focus management is poor. Give 10 points if fully accessible.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to autocomplete (e.g., built-in form validation) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., complex animations on every keystroke).
