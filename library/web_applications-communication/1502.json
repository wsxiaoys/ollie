  "question": "You are a coding expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration purposes. Could you help me design and create a personal website homepage? It would primarily be used for sharing photos, text, and videos within a small circle of family and friends. The purpose is to maintain and strengthen connections and emotional bonds between loved ones scattered across different regions, and to accumulate and showcase information about interactive activities among family and friends.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements photo, text, and video sharing capabilities through HTML/CSS/JavaScript, including file upload handling, content display grid/list views, and basic CRUD operations for posts. Score 0 if core sharing functionality is missing, 5 if only basic text/image sharing is implemented, and 10 if multimedia sharing with proper preview and organization is fully included.",

Evaluate if there's a proper user management system distinguishing family roles. Deduct 5 points if no user authentication exists, and 3 points if privacy controls are inadequate.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the homepage uses effective content categorization (albums, events, chronological timeline) and search/filter capabilities. Check if there's proper content archiving and easy navigation through historical posts. Deduct 5 points if content organization is chaotic or lacks categorization. Check whether memory preservation features like anniversary reminders or milestone highlighting are implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if family members can access content seamlessly across different devices. Deduct 5 points if mobile responsiveness is poor, and 3 points if data persistence mechanisms are missing. Give 10 points if fully optimized for family sharing scenarios.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to family sharing (e.g., e-commerce components, gaming features) 3. Overly complex effects that slow down content loading (e.g., heavy 3D animations, excessive parallax effects). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core sharing functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or component structure is poorly organized; deduct 5 points if media optimization is missing (lazy loading, compression); deduct 5 points if the code lacks maintainability.

Deduct 3 points for each element that feels cold or commercial, 5 points for poor accessibility for elderly users, and 5 points for cluttered layouts that distract from content.

Deduct 5 points for each confusing interaction flow, 3 points for slow media loading, and 5 points if elderly or less tech-savvy users would struggle with basic operations.
