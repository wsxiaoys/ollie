      "description": "Evaluate the calendar implementation to see if it properly displays important Chaoshan regional dates and events. Check whether it supports customization for different regions within Chaoshan (Chaozhou, Shantou, Jieyang), includes lunar calendar conversion for traditional festivals, and offers filtering/categorization of events. Score 0 if the calendar system is not implemented, 5 if basic calendar functionality exists but lacks regional specificity, and 10 if the implementation is comprehensive with region-specific important dates and proper cultural annotation.",

Check if the code implements interactive displays of Chaoshan traditions (such as Kungfu Tea ceremony, Chaoshan cuisine, opera), includes multimedia elements (images, audio, video), and provides historical context. Evaluate whether the information architecture allows for easy navigation between related customs.

Check whether the UI adheres to familiar WeChat Moments patterns while incorporating Chaoshan cultural elements. Verify the implementation of privacy controls and content filtering.

Check if calendar events can be shared to the forum, if cultural content can be referenced in posts, and if user-generated content can enhance cultural documentation. Assess if the navigation between sections is intuitive.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Chaoshan culture (e.g., general social media features that don't connect to the cultural focus) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when displaying calendar events).
