  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration whenever possible. Implement a private messaging feature for a forum where users have access to private messages from their personal center. When clicked, it takes them to a message list page displaying conversations with other users, showing the username of the other party and a summary of the most recent message. Clicking on a conversation enters a detailed message page where users can view the complete conversation history and send new messages.",
