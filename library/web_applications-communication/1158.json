Check if it includes proper token management (JWT or OAuth), cross-domain authentication handling, and secure communication protocols (HTTPS). Verify if the code includes authentication endpoints integration, token validation logic, and proper error handling for authentication failures. Score 0 if SSO isn't implemented, 5 if basic authentication is present but lacks security features, and 10 if a complete, secure SSO implementation is provided.",

Check if the code implements proper redirection logic for unauthenticated access attempts, handles role-based access control, and preserves the original navigation target after successful authentication. The implementation should prevent direct URL access to protected routes. Deduct 5 points if only basic route protection exists without proper redirection, 3 points if role-based permissions are missing. Full score for a complete navigation guard system with proper meta fields in route definitions.",

Verify the presence of token refresh logic, automatic login on page reload/revisit, and proper session timeout handling. The implementation should include initial auth state detection on application start. Deduct 5 points if token storage is insecure, 3 points if refresh tokens are not implemented, and 3 points if session expiration handling is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if error boundaries exist to prevent authentication failures from crashing the application. Code with strong robustness should handle these scenarios elegantly, giving 10 points.
