Check if user information storage and status management are properly handled. Score 0 if core login logic is missing, 5 if only basic login is implemented without proper error handling, and 10 if complete WeChat authorization flow with session management is fully implemented.",

Check if the page structure follows WeChat Mini Program design guidelines. Deduct 3 points for each missing core module, 5 points if navigation structure is unclear.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases and provide graceful degradation. Give 10 points if fully robust, 5 points if average robustness, 0 points if no exception handling.",

Function modules unrelated to scenic spot ticketing (e.g., built-in games or unrelated e-commerce) 3. Excessive animations that affect Mini Program performance.
