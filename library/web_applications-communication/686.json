Build an intelligent email template generator that supports variable interpolation (such as {name}), conditional logic blocks, and multi-topic A/B testing. Requirements include providing a visual editing interface, sending record tracking, and open rate statistics with chart displays.",

Score 0 if the core functionality is missing, 5 if only basic interpolation is implemented, and 10 if all required template features (interpolation, conditionals, and multi-topic A/B testing logic) are fully functional.",

Verify that users can easily insert variables, add conditional blocks, and set up A/B testing variants. Deduct 5 points if drag-and-drop functionality is missing, 3 points if real-time preview isn't available, and 2 points if the UI doesn't provide clear visual indicators for dynamic elements (variables, conditionals).

Verify that tracking pixels/codes are correctly implemented, and data collection respects privacy regulations. Check if the analytics dashboard provides meaningful metrics (open rates, click rates, conversion rates).

Code with strong robustness should validate all inputs, handle template parsing exceptions gracefully, and implement appropriate timeouts.

Function modules unrelated to email generation (e.g., a built-in social media manager) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations in the dashboard).
