  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable. Please help me create a feature in a WeChat Mini Program that allows filling out forms through voice input, structured as a component. The component's name should be \"Voice\" (as in the Chinese pinyin \"yuyin\"). Please write the code for all 4 files, using the \"simultaneous interpretation\" method we discussed earlier.",

      "description": "Check if the component follows the correct WXML, WXSS, JS, JSON structure with proper component declaration. The component should have a clear interface for integration. Verify that the component configuration in JSON properly registers the component with appropriate properties and options. Score 0 if missing essential files, 5 if basic structure exists but with issues, 10 if perfectly structured according to Mini Program best practices.",

Check if the implementation handles permissions, recording states, and converts speech to text accurately. The component should show appropriate UI states during recording (indicating recording in progress). Deduct 5 points if permissions handling is missing, 3 points if recording state management is poor. Full score requires robust error handling for recognition failures.",

Check if the component can handle different input types (text, number, etc.) and support both appending and replacing text modes.

Check if there's real-time text preview before final form submission. The solution should provide clear user feedback about recognition accuracy.
