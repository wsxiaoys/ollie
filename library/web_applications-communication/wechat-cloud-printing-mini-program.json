      "description": "Evaluate whether the code correctly implements the WeChat mini-program page structure (WXML, WXSS, JS) following WeChat's development standards. Check if the app.json, app.wxss, and necessary pages are defined. Score 0 if the basic structure is missing, 5 if only partial implementation exists, and 10 if the complete structure with proper configuration is implemented.",

Deduct 3 points for each missing core function. Give 10 points only if the complete printing workflow is implemented with proper error handling.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to cloud printing (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Excessive animations or effects that affect performance.
