  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to make the generated code executable for demonstration when possible. I am designing a website using Vue, divided into three parts: left, middle, and right. The left section contains the logo and navigation bar, followed by navigation options and functional options including Sports, Food, Travel, Culture, Technology, Leisure, as well as Message Notifications, Settings Center, and Logout. The middle section has a search box and profile picture, below which is an area for editing and publishing posts. Before editing a post, users need to select one of the same 6 categories that appear in the left navigation bar. Below this is where users' posts of various types are displayed. The right section of the website contains a friends list and an area for sending messages and chatting.",

      "title": "Is the Vue component structure properly organized?",
      "description": "Evaluate the project structure and component hierarchy. Check if components are properly segregated (e.g., NavigationBar, PostEditor, FriendsList), follow single responsibility principle, and use proper Vue best practices like props/emits for communication. Analyze if the layout is implemented with appropriate Vue directives, CSS Grid/Flexbox for the three-column layout. Deduct 5 points for monolithic components, 3 points for prop drilling beyond 2 levels, and 5 points if reactive data management is poorly implemented. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for active state styling, proper routing configuration, and visual hierarchy. Award 10 points for complete implementation with proper Vue Router integration, responsive design, and visual feedback. Deduct 3 points if navigation state persistence is missing, 3 points for accessibility issues, and 5 points if navigation items aren't properly linked to their corresponding views.",

Check for form validation, error handling, and state management during the post creation process. Give 10 points for a fully functional editor with appropriate input fields, category selection UI, real-time preview, and submission handling. Deduct 5 points if category validation is missing, 3 points for lack of draft saving, and 5 points if publishing doesn't update the feed view.",

Verify that real-time communication is implemented (or simulated). Award 10 points for complete implementation with message threading, typing indicators, and message status. Deduct 5 points if there's no message persistence mechanism, 3 points if friend status updates are missing, and 5 points if the chat UI doesn't scroll or handle long conversations properly.",

Check for proper form validation, defensive programming, and error boundaries. Award 10 points if the code effectively handles edge cases with meaningful user feedback. Give 5 points for average robustness (basic error handling), and 0 points if exceptions are unhandled or cause the application to crash.",

Function modules unrelated to the social/content platform (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations on scroll).

Check for proper separation of concerns, reusable components, and maintainability practices. Deduct 5 points if global state is overused, 5 points if components exceed 300 lines, and 5 points if there's no consideration for lazy loading large views/components. The full score is 10 points.",
