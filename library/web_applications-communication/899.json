      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements a responsive login form with HTML5 features (such as form validation, placeholder attributes, and semantic elements). Check if it includes essential login fields (username/email, password) and appropriate input types with attributes for validation. Score 0 if there's no HTML5 implementation, 5 if basic login fields exist but lack proper validation, and 10 if the implementation is complete with modern HTML5 features.",

Check if it includes modern styling techniques (flexbox/grid, transitions, etc.) and handles different screen sizes properly. Deduct 5 points if the interface doesn't adapt to mobile screens, 3 points if there are clear styling inconsistencies, and 2 points if accessibility features (focus states, contrast ratios) are missing.

Verify that it includes real-time validation feedback, password strength indicators, and proper error handling. Deduct 5 points if validation only happens on submission without real-time feedback, 3 points if error messages are not specific or helpful, and 2 points if password strength requirements aren't enforced.

Check if it implements token-based authentication (JWT/OAuth). Deduct 5 points if passwords are stored in plaintext/weak hashing, 5 points if there's no protection against brute force attacks, and 3 points if secure session handling is missing.

Code with strong robustness should handle connection timeouts, server errors, and input validation gracefully. Give 10 points if all edge cases are handled, 5 points if only basic error handling exists, and 0 points if errors cause the system to crash.",

Unnecessary API calls or data processing unrelated to authentication 3. Excessive animations or effects that slow down the login process. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core authentication function is compromised by redundant code.",

On the Java side, check for proper dependency injection, service-repository pattern, and exception handling. Deduct 5 points if global variables are overused; deduct 5 points if there's significant code duplication; deduct 5 points if logging is insufficient for debugging. The full score is 10 points.",
