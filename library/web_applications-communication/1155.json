      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements real-time streaming text display through Vue.js reactive data binding, including proper handling of Server-Sent Events (SSE) or chunked transfer encoding. Check if text chunks are progressively rendered with smooth character-by-character or word-by-word animation effects. Score 0 if streaming display is not implemented, 5 if only basic text appending is shown, and 10 if smooth streaming with proper buffering and display control is fully implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether Axios is correctly configured for streaming requests with proper responseType settings (stream/text), timeout handling, and progress monitoring. Check if Vue's reactive system is properly utilized for real-time UI updates without performance bottlenecks. Deduct 5 points if request cancellation is not implemented, and 3 points if memory leaks occur during long streaming sessions. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the ThinkPHP backend properly implements streaming response with correct headers (Transfer-Encoding: chunked or Content-Type: text/event-stream), handles Deepseek API integration with proper error handling and rate limiting. Verify if the backend maintains persistent connections and implements proper buffer flushing. Deduct 5 points if API key security is not handled, and 3 points if streaming connection drops are not managed. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if streaming parameters are correctly configured and if API rate limits and quotas are properly managed. Deduct 5 points if API response validation is missing, and 3 points if retry mechanisms for failed requests are not implemented. Give 10 points if fully implemented with comprehensive error recovery.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as network interruption, API timeouts, malformed responses, component unmounting during streaming, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases and provide graceful degradation, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Customizable streaming speed controls 3. Text highlighting with different colors for different content types 4. Export functionality for streamed content 5. Pause/resume streaming capabilities).

Function modules unrelated to streaming text display (e.g., built-in file management system) 3. Fancy effects that affect streaming performance (e.g., complex particle animations during text rendering). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core streaming functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or Vue best practices are not followed; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if proper component lifecycle management is missing.

Deduct 3 points for each poorly designed visual element, 5 points for poor text readability, and 5 points for chaotic layout during streaming. The full score is 10 points.",
