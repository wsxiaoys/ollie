      "description": "Check if the code implements proper mouse/touch event handling for dragging (mousedown/touchstart, mousemove/touchmove, mouseup/touchend), maintains state during drag operations, and correctly updates the button's position based on cursor/touch movement. Score 0 if dragging is not implemented, 5 if basic dragging works with issues, and 10 if the implementation is complete with smooth drag behavior.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Deduct 5 points for noticeable lag during dragging, 3 points for jumpy movement, and 2 points for lack of visual affordances indicating draggability. The full score is 10 points.",
