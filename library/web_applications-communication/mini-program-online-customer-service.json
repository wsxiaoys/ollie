Score 0 if the core UI components are missing, 5 if basic elements exist but lack proper styling, and 10 if the interface is complete with responsive design and appropriate placeholder states.",

Function modules unrelated to customer service (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations in conversation UI).
