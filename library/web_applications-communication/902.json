Now, as a Uni-app development expert, I want to implement Tencent UI-less integration with the following features: message list (fetching, automatic updates) + chat detail page + sending messages. Please help me implement the relevant code and provide corresponding explanations for each step.",

Check if message types (text, image, voice, etc.) are correctly displayed with appropriate timestamps. Score 0 if SDK initialization is missing, 5 if basic message display is implemented but lacks automatic updates, and 10 if complete with real-time message notifications and background polling.",

Verify if the code handles message status updates (sent, delivered, read) and updates the UI accordingly.
