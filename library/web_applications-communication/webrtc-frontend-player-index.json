      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements WebRTC connectivity including getUserMedia(), RTCPeerConnection handling, and ICE candidate exchange. Code should handle media constraints properly (video/audio selection, resolution settings). Score 0 if WebRTC is not implemented, 5 if only basic connection is established, and 10 if it includes complete signaling, connection establishment and error handling.",

The player should maintain aspect ratio while resizing and adapt to different screen sizes. Deduct 3 points if not centered, 3 points if not responsive, and 4 points if aspect ratio distortion occurs on resize. Full score is 10 points.",

Controls should be accessible and intuitive. Deduct 2 points for each missing essential control, and 1 point for poor UI integration.

Function modules unrelated to WebRTC video playback (e.g., unnecessary analytics) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations around the player).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation between WebRTC functionality and UI.
