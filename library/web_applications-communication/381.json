Verify that pages are properly linked with navigation elements (navbar, menu, footer links). Score 0 if fewer than 5 pages are implemented, 5 if the required number of pages exists but with structural issues, and 10 if the pages are well-organized with clear navigation paths and semantic HTML structure.",

Check for input validation (email format, required fields), error messages, remember me functionality, and session management. Deduct 3 points if validation is incomplete, 3 points if error handling is missing or unclear, and 5 points if session management is not implemented.
