How can I add two menu items in Gradio, one for dynamically switching dark mode, and another for dynamically switching themes?",

Score 0 if no menu implementation, 5 if basic implementation without proper styling, 10 if fully implemented with proper Gradio component integration.",

Examine if the implementation uses Gradio's built-in theme methods or custom JavaScript. Score 0 if not implemented, 5 if implemented but requires page refresh, 10 if fully dynamic with smooth transition effects.",

Function modules unrelated to theming (e.g., unnecessary UI components) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).

Deduct 5 points if global variable pollution is found or proper encapsulation is not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code is not structured logically for easy maintenance.
