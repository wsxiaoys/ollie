Evaluate if there are multiple blessing templates, customizable message styles, and engaging visual elements like floating hearts, confetti, or blessing animations.

Check if there's a mechanism to store and retrieve sent blessings, preview functionality, and options for different blessing occasions.

Evaluate if there's a blessing gallery, sharing options, and celebration effects. Deduct 5 points if the workflow is incomplete, and 3 points if user guidance is unclear.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to blessing simulation (e.g., built-in games or unrelated utilities) 3. Overly complex animations that detract from the main purpose.
