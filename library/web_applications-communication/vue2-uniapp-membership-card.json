      "description": "Review whether the Vue2 components properly implement the membership card with appropriate data structures (user information, card status, points/balance) and necessary interactions (view details, use card). Score 0 if the core card functionality is missing, 5 if basic display is implemented, and 10 if full functionality including conditional rendering based on membership levels is implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code properly uses uniApp's conditional compilation (@ifdef), responsive layouts, and platform-specific API calls. Check if styles adapt to different screen sizes and device capabilities. Deduct 3 points if only one platform works well, 5 points if platform-specific features aren't utilized appropriately.

      "description": "Examine whether the solution properly manages membership data (using Vuex or similar state management), implements appropriate caching strategies for offline usage, and handles state transitions (card activation, expiration, level upgrades). Deduct 5 points if there's no persistent storage solution, 3 points if state updates aren't reactive. The full score is 10 points.",

Assess if the solution includes verification methods (QR codes, barcodes) for in-store usage. Deduct 5 points if authentication is missing, 3 points if there's no expiration/refresh mechanism.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Interactive point redemption animations). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to membership cards (e.g., a built-in game unrelated to the loyalty program) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow rendering). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Judge whether the dynamic effects conform to human perception characteristics: 1) Card flip/reveal animations feel natural with proper easing 2) Transition animation duration controlled between 300-500ms 3) Clear visual feedback when scanning or using the card. Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for jerky animations during transitions, and 5 points for hard-to-find key function buttons. The full score is 10 points.",
