Check if the WebView is properly configured with essential properties like src, @message, and @error. Score 0 if the WebView is not implemented, 5 if basic loading works but lacks proper configuration, and 10 if fully implemented with proper error handling.",

Check for implementation of onNavigationBarButtonTap for iOS navigation. Deduct 5 points if history management is missing, 3 points if Android back button handling is not implemented.

Check if the app can receive messages from loaded web pages and send messages back. Deduct 5 points if one-way communication is missing, and 3 points if error handling for messages is inadequate.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to browser functionality 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during page loading).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if platform-specific adaptations are missing.
