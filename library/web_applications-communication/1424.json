Help me create an animal translator, which is an HTML software that can translate human language into animal language.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the translation logic from human language to animal language through JavaScript, including multiple animal language types (cat, dog, bird, etc.) and proper phonetic mapping algorithms. Score 0 if no translation logic is implemented, 5 if only basic single animal translation exists, and 10 if multiple animal languages with comprehensive vocabulary mapping are included.",

Deduct 5 points if voice input/output is missing, and 3 points if no input validation is implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the animal language system includes scientifically-based or creatively consistent language rules, proper grammar structures, and vocabulary databases for different animals. Two-way translation capability is required. Deduct 5 points if animal languages lack consistency or logical structure. Check whether multiple animal species are supported with distinct linguistic characteristics. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if translation history is not implemented, and 3 points if no progress indicators are shown during translation. Give 10 points if the complete user journey is seamlessly integrated.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Animal avatar animations that speak the translated text 3. Cultural context explanations for animal communication patterns 4. Batch translation for conversations). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to animal translation (e.g., a built-in weather widget) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle animations during translation). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core translation functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or proper separation of concerns is not implemented; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no proper error handling or logging mechanisms exist.

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for laggy animations during mode switching, and 5 points for unclear translation status indicators. The full score is 10 points.",
