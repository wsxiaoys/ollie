Check if React 18 specific features like createRoot are properly utilized instead of legacy ReactDOM.render. Score 0 if React 18+ is not used, 5 points if basic setup exists but lacks proper configuration, 10 points for a complete and well-structured React 18+ project setup.",

Check if the code leverages Tailwind's utility classes appropriately instead of custom CSS, uses responsive design classes (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.), and follows Tailwind best practices. Deduct 5 points if Tailwind is installed but barely used, 3 points if configuration is incomplete, and 2 points if utility classes are used inconsistently. Full score is 10 points.",

Check if components follow single responsibility principle and have clear props interfaces.

Check for proper form validation if forms exist, and handling of asynchronous operations. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no error handling or loading states exist, give 0 points.",

Unnecessary third-party libraries for tasks that could be accomplished with React/Tailwind 3. Overengineered solutions for simple problems.
