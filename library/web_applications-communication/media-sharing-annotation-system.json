      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a robust file upload system that handles both videos and photos. Check for file type validation, size limits, progress indicators, and proper error handling. Score 0 if basic upload functionality is missing, 5 if only basic uploads work without validation, and 10 if it includes comprehensive upload features including chunked uploads for large videos, retry mechanisms, and format conversion capabilities.",

For videos, check if it supports timeline-based annotations, frame-specific notes, and persistent storage of annotation data. For photos, verify region-based annotations, text formatting options, and proper positioning. Deduct 5 points if annotations cannot be edited after creation, and 3 points if annotation positioning is imprecise. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that sensitive content (faces, license plates, metadata) can be automatically detected and obscured during sharing. Deduct 5 points if sharing lacks permission settings, and 5 points if the automatic information hiding feature is absent or ineffective. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for conflict resolution mechanisms, version control of annotations, activity logging, and role-based permissions. Deduct 5 points if the system lacks real-time updates, and 5 points if there's no conflict resolution strategy.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core requirements (e.g., a built-in game or irrelevant social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that impact responsiveness).
