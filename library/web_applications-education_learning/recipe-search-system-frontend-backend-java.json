  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and expert responses. Be sure to ensure that the code you generate is executable when possible. Hello, I want to create a recipe search system, designing the frontend, backend, and algorithmic models. For the algorithmic models, I'm using Python and already have mature model code. Now I need your help designing the frontend and backend code, with requirements for rapid development and Java as the backend language.",

      "title": "Is the recipe search frontend interface well designed?",
      "description": "Review whether the frontend code implements an intuitive and user-friendly interface with proper search inputs, filters (ingredient, cuisine type, preparation time, etc.), and result display. Check for responsive design that works across devices. Score 0 if the interface is not implemented, 5 if only basic search functionality exists, and 10 if the interface includes advanced filtering, auto-suggestions, and a visually appealing recipe card display.",

      "description": "Evaluate the backend architecture for proper API design, RESTful principles, dependency injection, and service layer organization. Check if proper design patterns are used and if the code follows Java best practices. Deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation of concerns, 3 points if error handling is missing, and 3 points if data validation is inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the Python algorithmic model is properly integrated with the Java backend (using technologies like REST API, gRPC, or JNI). Verify the integration implementation includes proper serialization/deserialization, error handling, and efficient data transfer. Deduct 5 points if integration is unreliable or inefficient, 3 points if there's no caching mechanism for frequently accessed recipes. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper indexing to support fast searches, ORM implementation, and query optimization. Deduct 5 points if there's no consideration for recipe metadata (like ingredients, nutritional info), 3 points if there's no transaction management, and 3 points if there's no database migration strategy.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to recipe search (e.g., a built-in weather widget) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during recipe display). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
