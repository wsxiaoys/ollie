  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\n======== ROLE ========\nYou are an experienced code expert. I'm providing you with a software development requirement description, and I need you to generate project code based on these requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code that is fully commented with simple and easy-to-understand language. Don't output anything else.\n\n======== OUTPUT RULES ========\n1. Always generate complete, runnable project code and ensure the project is fully executable\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete, don't omit any code\n3. Carefully review and check all code before final output, evaluating its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, regenerate it\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or use of user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide simulated data\n\n======== PROJECT REQUIREMENTS ========\nCreate a to-do list application with learning reminder functionality. Users can add to-do tasks, with each task including a title, description, and planned completion time. When the time arrives, the website will notify users to complete the task through popup alerts and sound notifications.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code provides a complete to-do list implementation with adding, editing, marking as complete, and deleting tasks. Check if each task contains the required fields (title, description, planned completion time). Score 0 if basic to-do operations are missing, 5 if only basic CRUD is implemented without proper data validation, and 10 if all operations are implemented with proper validation and error handling.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a timing mechanism that checks for due tasks and triggers notifications at the specified times. Check if the system handles various time formats correctly and accounts for timezone considerations. Score 0 if there is no functional timing mechanism, 5 if basic timing exists but has edge cases (like handling browser tab focus/blur), and 10 if timing is precise with proper handling of all edge cases.",

Verify that the notification system requests and handles appropriate browser permissions. Check if notifications are shown even when the application is in the background. Deduct 5 points if either popup or sound notifications are missing, and 3 points if browser notification permissions are not properly handled. Full score requires both notification types working in all browser states.",

Check if tasks persist across browser refreshes and sessions. Verify that data loading and saving is handled efficiently without data loss.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to to-do list and reminders (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
