  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Please develop a video interactive Q&A creation tool that allows educators to upload instructional videos and insert interactive questions (such as single-choice, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.) at specific time points in the video. When learners watch to the corresponding time point, the video will automatically pause, display the question, and continue playing after the answer is provided. The system needs to collect data on learners' responses and generate learning reports. It should support question bank management and random question selection functionality.",

Score 0 if no functional video player exists, 5 if basic video playback works but has timing accuracy issues (>500ms error), and 10 if the integration is seamless with frame-accurate question triggering (<100ms error).",
