      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements OCR capabilities specifically optimized for mathematical notation (including operators, fractions, exponents, integrals, etc.). Check if it uses appropriate libraries like Tesseract with math-specific training data or specialized math OCR solutions like Mathpix. Score 0 if no OCR is implemented, 5 if basic text OCR is implemented without math optimization, and 10 if it handles complex mathematical notations effectively.",

Check if it implements contour detection, shape recognition algorithms, and geometric property extraction. Score 0 if geometric pattern recognition is absent, 5 if only basic shapes are detected without proper mathematical interpretation, and 10 if it can identify complex geometric configurations with proper mathematical analysis.",

Check if the system can handle various types of math problems (algebraic equations, calculus, geometry). Deduct 5 points if the AI component only works for limited problem types, and 3 points if it doesn't provide step-by-step solutions. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to mathematical OCR or problem-solving 3. Excessive UI components that complicate the user experience.
