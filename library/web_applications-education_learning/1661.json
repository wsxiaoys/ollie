Create a front-end for the \"Review Writer\" website project using React framework, with a design style that is cutting-edge and tech-oriented while maintaining an academic aesthetic. The website navigation includes: Home, Data Analysis, Journal Recommendations, Resource Search, Literature Management, Research Proposals, Writing Assistant, and Security & Version Management.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the code uses a clean component hierarchy with proper separation of concerns (presentational vs. container components). Check for context API or Redux for state management. Code should implement React hooks appropriately and avoid anti-patterns. Reusable components should be modular with well-defined props. Score 0 if React is not properly implemented, 5 if basic components exist but lack proper structure, 10 if the architecture follows best practices with clean component composition.",

Check if React Router is properly configured with appropriate routes, including nested routing where applicable. Verify navigation state persistence across refreshes, browser history support, and URL parameter handling. Score 3 if basic navigation exists, 7 if most items are implemented with routing, 10 if comprehensive navigation with proper state management is implemented.",

      "description": "Assess whether the design balances modern tech aesthetics (clean lines, appropriate white space, subtle animations) with academic elements (structured layout, legible typography, scholarly color scheme). Check for consistency in UI components across all pages. The design should have visual hierarchy with clear content organization. Score 3 if the basic style is present but inconsistent, 7 if design is cohesive but lacks refinement, 10 if the UI demonstrates sophisticated design principles with perfect balance between tech and academic aesthetics.",

Data Analysis should have data visualization components, Journal Recommendations should have filtering capabilities, Resource Search needs proper search functionality, Literature Management requires document organization features, Research Proposals section should have document creation tools, Writing Assistant needs text editing capabilities, and Security & Version Management should include version control UI.

Code with strong robustness should include error boundaries, form validation, loading states, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points if only basic validation exists, and 0 points if no error handling is implemented.",

Function modules unrelated to academic writing/research (e.g., social media feeds) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or unnecessarily complex visualizations).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not properly configured.
