  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be careful to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Design a learning partner matching system that intelligently pairs users based on their learning goals, interests, and time schedules. Users can browse matching results and send invitations for collaborative learning. The system should record users' pairing history and feedback to optimize the matching algorithm.",

      "description": "Review whether the code includes comprehensive user profiles with learning goals, interests, skill levels, time availability, and preferred learning styles. Check if users can update their preferences and if the system stores this information persistently. Score 0 if basic user data collection is missing, 5 if only basic fields are implemented, and 10 if the profile system is comprehensive with validation and privacy controls.",

      "title": "Is the matching algorithm properly designed and implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate the matching algorithm's sophistication - check if it considers multiple factors (learning goals, interests, schedule compatibility, skill level) with appropriate weighting. The algorithm should use more than simple filtering and include some form of scoring or ranking. Deduct 5 points if compatibility calculation is too simplistic, and 3 points if there's no consideration for complementary skills. Score 10 if the algorithm includes machine learning components or adaptive weighting based on past matches.",

      "description": "Check whether the system includes ways for users to browse potential matches, send invitations, accept/decline requests, and initiate communication. Verify if invitation status tracking is implemented and whether notifications are provided. Deduct 5 points if the invitation flow is incomplete, and 3 points if there's no way to message or communicate with potential partners. Give 10 points if real-time notifications and multiple communication channels are implemented.",

Check if there's a system for rating partnerships and providing structured feedback. Deduct 5 points if feedback collection is missing, and 3 points if collected data isn't fed back into the matching algorithm.

Check for input validation, security measures against data tampering, and graceful failure modes. Give 10 points if the code handles most edge cases elegantly, 5 points for average robustness with some unhandled exceptions, and 0 points if critical paths lack error handling.",

Function modules unrelated to learning partnerships (e.g., extensive social media features) 3. Resource-intensive features that affect core functionality (e.g., unnecessary animations or media). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
