  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Please design a word memorization system (similar to the Dingxiao Word Memorization System) using the vocabulary from the People's Education Press high school English curriculum, with adjustable daily learning quantities. The memorization system should first display English words and their Chinese meanings, then have students choose the correct Chinese meaning for given English words, followed by showing incomplete English words for students to complete, and finally presenting misspelled words again for correction. This pattern should repeat over subsequent days until all high school English vocabulary has been memorized. Please generate this word memorization system immediately.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a complete database of PEP high school English vocabulary with proper data structure (words, definitions, example sentences, difficulty levels, etc.). Check if the vocabulary is organized by units/lessons and if metadata includes part of speech and phonetic symbols. Score 0 if only placeholder words are used, 5 if basic word structure is implemented but incomplete, and 10 if a comprehensive dictionary with proper organization is included.",

The algorithm should track user performance and adjust review frequency accordingly (similar to SM-2 algorithm or Leitner system). Deduct 5 points if words appear in fixed intervals regardless of mastery level, and 3 points if there's no decay factor for long-term memory. The full score is 10 points.",

Each mode should have proper input validation and scoring.

The system should provide persistence (local storage or server-side) to maintain progress between sessions.
