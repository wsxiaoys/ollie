  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable whenever possible. As an experienced web developer, I need you to create a webpage that collects information about energy storage from across the internet each week, organizes it by category, and presents it on the webpage for my learning and reference. Since I work in human resources, I would also like to include knowledge related to human resources in the energy storage field. The page should be simple and clear.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes robust web scraping mechanisms to collect energy storage information from various sources. Check if it handles different website structures, uses proper request throttling to avoid IP blocking, and implements error handling for failed requests. Score 0 if no scraping functionality exists, 5 if basic scraping is implemented but lacks robustness, and 10 if comprehensive scraping with multiple source handling is included.",

Assess if the categorization is dynamic or static, and whether it can adapt to changing content patterns. Deduct 3 points if the categories are hardcoded without flexibility, and 5 points if HR-specific categories are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the solution uses an appropriate database or storage method (localStorage, IndexedDB, or server-side database), implements data versioning, and has mechanisms to prevent duplicate entries. Assess whether the update process is automated or manual. Deduct 5 points if there's no persistence mechanism, and 3 points if the weekly update process requires manual intervention.

Check if the HR-specific information is visually distinguished from other energy storage categories. Deduct 3 points for cluttered layouts, 5 points for poor readability (small fonts, low contrast), and 5 points for overly complex navigation structures. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to energy storage information (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow page loading).
