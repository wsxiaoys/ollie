      "title": "Is the word importing mechanism fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements mechanisms for importing vocabulary from multiple external sources (e.g., file upload, API integration, copy-paste). Check if it handles different formats (CSV, TXT, JSON) and provides validation for imported data. Score 0 if importing is not implemented, 5 if only basic single-format importing exists, and 10 if comprehensive multi-source importing with validation is included.",

Check if it includes proper organization (categories, tags, difficulty levels), search functionality, sorting options, and persistent storage (localStorage, IndexedDB). Deduct 3 points if there's no search function, 3 points if persistent storage is missing, and 4 points if the data structure doesn't support word categorization. The full score is 10 points.",

Assess if the review schedules adjust based on user performance. Deduct 5 points if no spaced repetition is implemented, 3 points if progress tracking is missing, and 2 points if there's no adaptivity in the learning sequence. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if different memory reinforcement techniques are used and if there's variety in the practice methods. Score 0 if only basic word display exists, 5 if there's one interactive mode with feedback, and 10 if multiple engaging learning methods are implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid imports, browser storage limitations, network issues during API calls, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Gamification elements with rewards/streaks 4. Social sharing of progress). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to vocabulary learning 3. Fancy effects that affect loading performance and distract from learning. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
