Please help me write HTML code for a science and technology festival website with the theme of campus technology festival. The content is divided into three sections: robot dogs, industrial robots, and humanoid robots. Each section should have three images scrolling on the left side and text on the right side introducing their current development status.",

      "description": "Check whether the HTML correctly separates the content into three distinct sections for robot dogs, industrial robots, and humanoid robots. Each section should be clearly demarcated with appropriate semantic HTML5 tags (e.g., <section>, <article>). Deduct 5 points if sections blend together visually, 5 points if semantic HTML is not used, and 5 points if the sections are not equally prominent. The full score is 10 points.",

The scrolling should work automatically and/or through user interaction. Check for proper image transitions, navigation controls, and responsive design. Score 0 if scrolling is not implemented, 5 if basic scrolling exists but with flaws (e.g., no navigation controls, jerky transitions), and 10 if the scrolling is smooth, intuitive, and fully functional across device sizes.",

The layout should maintain this structure at appropriate breakpoints. Deduct 5 points if even one section has incorrect layout, 3 points if the layout breaks on common device sizes, and 2 points if there are significant spacing issues between the image and text areas.

The content should be informative, relevant to a technology festival context, and include key technical details or advancements. Deduct 3 points per section if content is generic/placeholder text, 2 points per section if content lacks technical depth, and 5 points if content is completely unrelated to robot technology.

Code with strong robustness should include alt text for images, handle text overflow gracefully, and adapt to different viewport sizes. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling and responsiveness, 5 points for partial implementation, and 0 points if no robustness measures are implemented.",

Function modules unrelated to the science and technology festival theme 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or effects that slow page loading). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core presentation is interfered with by redundant code.",
