      "description": "Verify if the code accurately implements the key knowledge points from the 8th grade Modern Chinese History curriculum (People's Education Press edition), including critical historical events (1840-1949), important figures, and historical significance. Score 0 if major historical events are missing or inaccurately portrayed, 5 if basic content is present but lacks depth, and 10 if comprehensive coverage with proper historical context is provided.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of game mechanics such as scoring systems, achievement badges, level progression, challenges/quizzes, and reward mechanisms that enhance learning. Check if the game elements are aligned with educational objectives rather than being merely decorative. Deduct 5 points if gamification is superficial (e.g., only points without meaningful progression), and 3 points if engagement mechanics don't reinforce historical knowledge. Full score for a comprehensive system that balances entertainment with educational value.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code implements interactive elements like timeline exploration, historical scenario simulations, decision-making activities based on historical events, or knowledge verification quizzes. Verify that interactions provide meaningful feedback that reinforces learning. Deduct 5 points if interactions are limited to basic clicking without educational value, 3 points if feedback mechanisms are missing. Full score requires diverse interaction types that support different learning styles.",

Visuals should clarify complex historical concepts rather than just decorate. Deduct 5 points for inaccurate historical visuals, 3 points for poor visual hierarchy that obscures historical relationships. Full score for visualizations that genuinely enhance understanding of historical cause and effect.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to history education (e.g., mini-games without historical context) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that distract from learning).
