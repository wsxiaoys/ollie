  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the code you generate is executable and can be demonstrated. I am a young teacher teaching second grade (second semester). I now want to develop a mental arithmetic mini-program for second grade (second semester). This mini-program mainly focuses on multiplication tables as its core, then includes some calculations with multiplication and division, as well as fill-in-the-blank exercises for multiplication tables. These could involve not knowing the first multiplicand and having to fill it in to calculate the product, or not knowing the product or multiplicand and having to fill it in. This mental arithmetic program needs to be under my control with certain buttons. These buttons should preferably be displayed in Chinese.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the complete multiplication tables (1-9) with proper display and interactions. Check if the program allows students to practice, review, and be tested on the tables. Score 0 if the core functionality is missing, 5 if only basic tables are shown without interaction, and 10 if all multiplication tables are fully interactive with proper learning progression.",

Check if the program generates appropriate difficulty levels for grade 2 students. Deduct 3 points for each missing exercise type. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if visual/audio feedback is child-friendly and educational.

Function modules unrelated to math learning (e.g., unnecessary games) 3. Fancy effects that may distract young learners.
