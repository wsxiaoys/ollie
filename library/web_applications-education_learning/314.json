      "description": "Review whether the HTML code correctly represents the standard periodic table layout with all 118 elements positioned in their correct groups and periods. Check if the table maintains proper spacing and alignment between elements. Score 0 if elements are missing or misplaced, 5 if the basic structure is implemented but with minor positioning errors, and 10 if the periodic table structure is complete and accurately arranged.",

Check if information is presented in a clear hierarchy with appropriate technical detail for the middle school level. Deduct 5 points if key information is missing, 3 points if the detail level is inappropriate for middle schoolers. Give 10 points if comprehensive and age-appropriate.",

      "description": "Assess if the code includes interactive features that aid learning, such as element highlighting, pop-up information cards, filtering by element properties, or visual grouping by element categories. Deduct 5 points if no interactivity is implemented, 3 points if interactions are limited or buggy. Give 10 points for comprehensive, smooth, and educationally valuable interactions.",

Deduct 5 points if categories are not visually distinguished, 3 points if visual coding is present but confusing or lacks a legend. Give 10 points for clear, consistent, and educational visual categorization.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common issues (such as various screen sizes, browser compatibility, loading failures for resources) and provides fallbacks or graceful degradation. Code with strong robustness should work across modern browsers and accommodate different viewport sizes. Give 10 points for comprehensive robustness with responsive design, 5 points if partially robust, and 0 points if serious compatibility issues exist.",

Excessive animations or effects that distract from learning. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if redundant code interferes with the educational purpose.",

Deduct 5 points if non-semantic div/span elements dominate the structure; deduct 5 points if CSS/JS is not separated from HTML; deduct 5 points if the code contains unnecessary dependencies or unoptimized resources.

Deduct 5 points for interactions that don't support learning goals, 3 points for overly complex interactions beyond middle school comprehension, and 5 points for missing scaffolding in presenting information.
