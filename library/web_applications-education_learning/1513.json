      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes proper Vue application initialization, component structure, and project organization. Look for a main Vue instance, component registration, and appropriate separation of concerns. Score 0 if Vue is not properly initialized, 5 if basic setup exists but lacks organization, and 10 if the project follows Vue best practices with proper component hierarchy and module structure.",

Verify implementation of state management (Vuex store, reactive data, or composition API). Deduct 5 points if there's no error handling for failed requests, 3 points if caching mechanisms are absent.

Verify that article previews show essential information (title, date, source, thumbnail).

Function modules unrelated to news (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
