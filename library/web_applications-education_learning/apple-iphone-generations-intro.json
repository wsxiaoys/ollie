      "description": "Review whether the HTML/CSS structure accurately implements a comprehensive timeline or grid of iPhone generations, from the original iPhone to the latest models. Check if each iPhone has its own section/card with consistent layout. Score 0 if missing multiple generations, 5 if only major generations are included, and 10 if all generations including variants (e.g., Pro, Max, Plus models) are properly represented.",

Deduct 2 points for each major information category missing, and 1 point for incomplete technical specifications. The full score is 10 points.",

Images should be properly sized, optimized, and responsive. Assess whether alt text is provided for accessibility. Deduct 5 points if visuals are missing for multiple models, 3 points if images are of poor quality or not responsive, and 2 points if alt text is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for filtering options by features, year, or specifications.

Code with strong robustness should implement responsive design principles, polyfills for older browsers, and graceful error handling. Give 10 points for comprehensive robustness, 5 points for average implementation, and 0 points if critical fallbacks are missing.",

Color-accurate iPhone rendering 4. Audio demonstrations of features). Add 2.5 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to iPhone information (e.g., unrelated product categories) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or unnecessary parallax effects). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
