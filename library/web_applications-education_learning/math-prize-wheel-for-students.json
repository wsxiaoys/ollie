  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable when possible.\n\nI am a middle school math teacher who wants to reward students with excellent grades. Please help me create a prize wheel webpage with the following prizes: $5 cash, $10 cash, $20 cash, $50 cash, Study Master Time Manager, Error Correction Printer + Math Meme Tape, \"Genshin Impact\" Character Pencil Case + Function Coordinate Notebook + Draft Paper, Probability Question Mystery Box Pen, Honor of Kings Q-version Heroes + Sarcastic Quote Stickers. The webpage should have a cute style background that includes elements middle school students enjoy, with animation effects when the wheel spins.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a spinning wheel mechanism through HTML5 Canvas/SVG and JavaScript, with proper physics-based deceleration and random/weighted result selection. Check if it includes prize highlighting when landing, and validation that prevents manipulation. Score 0 if the core spinning functionality is not implemented, 5 if basic spinning exists but lacks physics, and 10 if it includes realistic inertia, proper randomization, and anti-cheat mechanisms.",

Deduct 1 point for each missing prize or if prizes are not clearly readable when the wheel is stationary. Full points require visually distinct prize segments with proper spacing.",

      "description": "Check if the wheel animation includes smooth rotation transitions, proper easing functions (initial acceleration and gradual deceleration), audio feedback, and visual indicators during spinning. Score 3 points for basic rotation, 3 additional points for proper easing physics, 2 points for spinning sound effects, and 2 points for visual feedback (like sparkling effects or dynamic highlights). Ensure the animation runs at consistently smooth framerates (minimum 30 FPS).",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the background incorporates age-appropriate design elements that appeal to middle school students (gaming references, math symbols, colorful patterns, etc.). Background should be relevant to both prize themes (games like Genshin Impact/Honor of Kings and educational items) without overwhelming the main prize wheel. Deduct 5 points if the background is generic/stock, 3 points if it's too childish or too mature, and 3 points if it competes with or obscures the wheel functionality.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Teacher controls for probability adjustment 4. Animated characters reacting to prizes 5. Math formula animations).

Function modules unrelated to the prize wheel (e.g., unrelated games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that cause lag).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if variable naming is inconsistent or unclear.
