      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the multiple-choice question system for Chemistry, including question presentation, answer selection, and result evaluation. Check if questions are correctly structured with chemistry-specific content (e.g., chemical formulas, reactions, principles). Score 0 if core functionality is missing, 5 if basic quiz features exist but lack chemistry specificity, and 10 if the system fully accommodates chemistry content with proper formatting.",

Check for question variety and difficulty levels that match academic assessment standards. Deduct 5 points if topics are too generic, 5 points if content doesn't align with curriculum requirements, and 3 points if question variety is insufficient. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate whether the system provides detailed feedback with explanations for wrong answers and suggests areas for improvement. Deduct 5 points if only basic scoring exists without analysis, and 3 points if feedback lacks educational value. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the algorithm effectively identifies and prioritizes weak areas. Deduct 5 points if questions appear randomly without adaptation, 3 points if the system lacks personalization features, and 3 points if there's no mechanism to reinforce difficult concepts.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like disconnections during quiz submission or corrupted question data. Give 10 points if exception handling is comprehensive, 5 points if basic error handling exists, and 0 points if exceptions are unmanaged.",

Function modules unrelated to chemistry learning (e.g., games not tied to educational content) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations slowing question loading).

Check if chemistry-specific content rendering (formulas, equations) is properly abstracted. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
