      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the diagnostic patterns from Shang Han Lun, including the Six Stages (六经) diagnostic framework and proper syndrome differentiation. Score 0 if the core diagnostic logic is missing, 5 if basic patterns are implemented but incomplete, and 10 if comprehensive diagnostic pathways are included with accurate symptom-to-pattern mapping.",

The system should use weighted algorithms to analyze symptom combinations. Deduct 5 points if critical symptoms from Shang Han Lun are missing, and 3 points if the symptom relationships don't reflect traditional diagnostic principles. The full score is 10 points.",

Must include at least 20 core formulas with their modifications. Deduct 5 points if formula compositions are inaccurate, and 3 points if the modification rules don't follow traditional principles.

Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle edge cases in diagnosis, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
