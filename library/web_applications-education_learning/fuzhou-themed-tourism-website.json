  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. Help me create a Fuzhou-themed tourism website with a navigation bar that includes homepage, login, registration, navigation, weather, special tourism products, scenic area details, and scenic area search. The navigation bar should display secondary pages when clicked. Please show the complete code.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a complete website structure with proper HTML5 semantic elements (header, nav, main, footer) and CSS organization. Check if all required pages are properly linked: homepage, login, registration, navigation, weather, tourism products, scenic area details, and search functionality. Score 0 if the basic structure is missing, 5 if only partial pages are implemented, and 10 if all required pages are structurally complete with proper routing/linking.",

      "description": "Examine whether the navigation bar includes all required sections and properly implements dropdown/secondary pages functionality. Check if the navigation transitions are smooth, and if proper event handling exists for showing/hiding secondary menus. Verify mobile responsiveness of the navigation system. Deduct 3 points if any section is missing, 5 points if dropdown functionality isn't working, and 3 points if mobile navigation isn't responsive. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the website incorporates authentic Fuzhou cultural elements, landmarks, and tourism information. Check for Fuzhou-specific imagery, color schemes reflecting local culture, and accurate descriptions of attractions. Deduct 5 points if generic tourism templates are used without customization, 3 points if Fuzhou-specific content is minimal, and 5 points if key Fuzhou attractions are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the functional components are properly implemented with appropriate input validation, form handling, and API integration (especially for weather data). Check if the search functionality includes filtering options and result display. Deduct 3 points for each non-functional component and 5 points if client-side validation is missing. Score 10 points only if all functional components are properly implemented with error handling.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid inputs, image loading failures, API errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Cultural mini-games showcasing local traditions 3. Virtual tour capabilities with 360° imagery). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to tourism (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow page loading). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global CSS/JS variables pollute the namespace; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no responsive design principles are applied.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the overall design follows modern design principles: 1) Harmonious color matching (consistent with Fuzhou cultural elements) 2) Proper layout spacing (element spacing follows the 8px multiple principle) 3) Professional font system (body font size ≥ 14px, line height over 1.5 times). Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for visual after-images during fast sliding, and 5 points for hard-to-find key function buttons. The full score is 10 points.",
