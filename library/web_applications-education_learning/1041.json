  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Develop a small application for assessing enterprise digital transformation maturity, preferably one that can be operated by scanning a QR code, and provide an operation guide.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a comprehensive assessment system with properly defined maturity dimensions (e.g., technology, people, process, customer experience), scoring mechanics, and result interpretation. Score 0 if the core assessment logic is missing, 5 if only basic scoring is implemented without proper dimensions, and 10 if the assessment framework follows industry standards (like CMMI or other recognized maturity models) with clear dimension definitions.",

Verify if the application is fully responsive across different mobile devices (iOS/Android) with appropriate viewport settings and flexible layouts. Deduct 5 points if QR code scanning fails on common devices, and 3 points if the mobile layout breaks on standard screen sizes. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if assessment results can be saved, retrieved, and compared over time to track maturity progress. Deduct 5 points if results cannot be saved between sessions, and 3 points if there's no way to export or share results. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to digital transformation assessment (e.g., unrelated analytics) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations that slow down the application).
