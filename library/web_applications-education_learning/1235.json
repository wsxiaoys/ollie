      "description": "Review whether the code implements a complete vocabulary learning system with conversation-based interactions. Check for core features like word presentation, definition retrieval, quiz functionality, and progress tracking. Score 0 if core learning logic is absent, 5 if basic vocabulary display exists, and 10 if a comprehensive system with contextual learning is implemented.",

Check for proper dialog flow, natural language processing capabilities, appropriate response handling, and conversation history management. Deduct 5 points if the conversation flow is linear and inflexible, 3 points if user inputs are poorly handled. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the application uses proven learning techniques like spaced repetition, retrieval practice, or interleaving. Evaluate whether the system adapts to user performance and schedules reviews accordingly. Deduct 5 points if learning algorithms are basic or static, 3 points if vocabulary scheduling lacks personalization. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper data models, efficient storage solutions (local storage, database), and data persistence mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if data structure is inefficient for vocabulary learning, 3 points if there's no persistence between sessions. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Visual mnemonic aids 4. Gamification elements). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to vocabulary learning (e.g., a built-in general chat system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core learning functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
