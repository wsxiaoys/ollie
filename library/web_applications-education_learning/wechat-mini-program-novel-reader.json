I am a beginner in computer programming, but I want to create a WeChat Mini Program for reading novels. Based on my situation, please design a Mini Program for me with code that can run independently and normally. The novel content should be able to update in real time. Please design this for me.",

      "description": "Review whether the code includes the essential files for a WeChat Mini Program (app.js, app.json, app.wxss, and page files with .js, .json, .wxml, and .wxss extensions). Check if the project structure follows Mini Program conventions and if the configuration in app.json is properly set up with necessary pages, window settings, and tabBar if applicable. Score 0 if the core structure is missing, 5 if basic structure exists but has configuration errors, and 10 if properly implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements core novel reading features: chapter navigation, content rendering, font size adjustment, background color themes, and reading progress tracking. Check if text rendering handles different character sets and formats properly. Deduct 3 points if chapter navigation is missing, 3 points if font/theme customization is absent, and 4 points if progress tracking is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the code includes a robust mechanism for novel content updates: API integration for fetching new chapters, efficient caching strategy, and update notifications. Assess whether it handles network failures gracefully with retry logic. Deduct 4 points if there's no proper caching, 3 points if update notifications are missing, and 3 points if offline reading capability is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the interface adapts to different screen sizes and orientations. Deduct 3 points for poor text formatting, 4 points for non-responsive design, and 3 points if there's no night mode for comfortable reading in low light. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as network failures, API timeouts, malformed responses, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Check if exception handling covers user operation errors and edge cases. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these issues, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Reading statistics and achievements system). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to novel reading (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during page turns). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check if the code follows Mini Program best practices. Deduct 4 points if global state management is chaotic; deduct 3 points if the code duplication rate is high; deduct 3 points if comments are insufficient or misleading. The full score is 10 points.",
