      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements audio playback through HTML5 Audio API or Web Audio API, including audio preloading, play/pause controls, volume management, and cross-browser compatibility. Check if audio formats are optimized (MP3/OGG/WAV support) and if audio loading states are handled properly. Score 0 if audio cannot play, 5 if basic playback works but lacks controls, and 10 if full audio management is implemented with error handling.",

Check if themes are loaded dynamically or statically, whether switching preserves user state, and if theme data is well-structured (JSON/object format). Deduct 5 points if theme switching causes page refresh, 3 points if audio/images don't update correctly during switches. Full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if button states (normal/hover/active/disabled) are clearly defined and if touch/mouse events are handled correctly across devices. Deduct 5 points if buttons lack visual feedback, 3 points if keyboard accessibility is missing, 2 points if touch events don't work on mobile devices. Full score is 10 points.",

Check if loading indicators are shown during resource fetching, if fallback mechanisms exist for failed loads, and if resources are optimized for web delivery. Deduct 5 points if resources aren't preloaded causing delays, 3 points if no loading states are shown, 2 points if large files aren't optimized. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle browser compatibility issues, resource loading errors, and user interaction edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to audio-visual learning (e.g., built-in calculator or weather widget) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during audio playback). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core learning functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for proper event handling, memory leak prevention (audio object cleanup), and performance optimization. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or no design patterns are used; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if audio resources aren't properly disposed.
