Check for proper handling of different chapter navigation, bookmarks, and reading progress tracking. Score 0 if core reading functionality is missing, 5 if basic reading is implemented but lacks navigation features, and 10 if all essential reader functions are included.",

Check for proper model classes representing book and chapter data. Verify that JSON parsing is performed off the main thread to prevent UI freezes. Deduct 5 points if no error handling exists, 3 points if parsing blocks the UI thread, and 2 points if model classes are poorly designed. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to novel reading (e.g., built-in games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during page turns).

Examine proper dependency injection usage, static analysis tools integration, and code documentation. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 3 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 2 points if build variants (debug/release) are not properly configured.
