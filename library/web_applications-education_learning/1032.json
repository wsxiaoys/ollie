      "description": "Review whether the code correctly imports and initializes Blockly within a Vue component, properly renders the Blockly workspace, handles Vue lifecycle hooks (mounted, beforeDestroy), and manages the Blockly instance. Score 0 if Blockly isn't properly integrated with Vue, 5 if basic integration exists but with flaws, and 10 if the integration is seamless with proper component architecture.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Vue/Blockly integration (e.g., a built-in file explorer) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations in the Blockly workspace).
