      "description": "Review whether the webpage accurately captures the Gravity Falls aesthetic through proper use of the show's visual elements, color palette (forest greens, mystery blues, rustic browns), and thematic content. Check for inclusion of iconic elements like the Mystery Shack, Bill Cipher symbols, journal pages, or woodland mystery themes. Score 0 if generic content with no show connection, 5 if basic theme elements present, and 10 if fully immersive Gravity Falls atmosphere with authentic visual references.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the webpage includes comprehensive Gravity Falls content such as character profiles (Dipper, Mabel, Grunkle Stan, etc.), episode guides, mystery elements, or interactive features. Check for proper HTML semantic structure with appropriate headings, sections, and navigation. Deduct 3 points if content is superficial, 5 points if navigation is confusing or missing, and 3 points if semantic HTML structure is poor. Full score requires rich, well-structured content.",

      "description": "Check whether the webpage includes engaging interactive features that enhance the Gravity Falls experience, such as hover effects on mystery symbols, clickable journal entries, character animations, or hidden easter eggs. Evaluate JavaScript implementation for smooth interactions. Deduct 5 points if interactions are buggy or non-functional, 3 points if animations are choppy, and 5 points if no interactive elements exist. Full score requires polished, theme-appropriate interactivity.",

      "description": "Assess whether images, videos, audio, or other media elements are properly integrated and optimized. Check for appropriate alt text, proper file formats, responsive image handling, and loading performance. Verify that media enhances the Gravity Falls theme rather than generic placeholder content. Deduct 3 points for missing alt text, 5 points for poor loading performance, and 3 points for inappropriate or low-quality media. Full score requires optimized, thematic multimedia integration.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common issues such as missing images, JavaScript errors, responsive breakpoints, and browser compatibility. Code should include proper error handling, fallbacks for missing resources, and graceful degradation. Strong robustness earns 10 points. Average robustness with some error handling gets 5 points. No error handling or frequent crashes gets 0 points.",

Add 3 points for each well-implemented innovative feature (maximum 10 points). Features must be functional and add genuine value to the user experience.",

      "description": "Strictly check for three types of redundancy: 1) Duplicate functionality (multiple navigation systems) 2) Off-theme elements unrelated to Gravity Falls 3) Performance-heavy effects that don't serve the content (excessive animations, auto-playing videos). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found. Deduct 10 points directly if redundant code significantly impacts core functionality or page performance.",

Check for separation of concerns (HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript behavior), proper file organization, and clean code practices. Deduct 5 points for inline styles or scripts mixing concerns; deduct 5 points for code duplication over 30%; deduct 5 points for poor naming conventions or lack of comments.
