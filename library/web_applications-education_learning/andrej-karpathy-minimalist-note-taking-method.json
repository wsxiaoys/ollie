Check if features include: unified note entry/editing, hierarchical tag system, search functionality, and note linking mechanisms. Score 0 if the single-file concept is not implemented, 5 if only basic note management exists, and 10 if the complete minimalist methodology with advanced search and organization is fully realized.",
