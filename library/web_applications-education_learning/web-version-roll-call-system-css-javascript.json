      "description": "Review whether the code implements the essential features of a roll call system: adding/removing names, marking attendance (present/absent/late), and saving attendance records. Score 0 if these core functions are missing, 5 if only basic name listing exists, and 10 if comprehensive attendance tracking with timestamps and status indicators is implemented.",

Check if the implementation includes data export functionality (CSV/JSON/PDF formats) and retrieval of historical records. Deduct 5 points if there's no data storage, 3 points if storage exists but without export options. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to roll call (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
