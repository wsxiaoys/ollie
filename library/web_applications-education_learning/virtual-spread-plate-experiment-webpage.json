  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be careful to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. I am a biology teacher and need help designing an HTML webpage for a virtual experiment demonstration of the spread plate technique for a biology class. The webpage should include experimental materials and equipment: test tubes with yeast culture broth, cotton plugs, solid culture medium, inoculation loops, alcohol lamp (flammable), clean bench, and inoculation loops. The material and tool icons should be aesthetically pleasing and resemble actual images, with colors matching the real objects. Icons should be positioned on both sides of the page, movable, and highly interactive.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements all key steps of the spread plate technique (sterilizing the loop, cooling, sampling, inoculation, spreading, incubation). Score 0 if core procedure steps are missing, 5 if basic steps are implemented but lack scientific accuracy, and 10 if all microbiology protocols are followed with proper sequence and safety considerations.",

Deduct 2 points for each missing item. All items must be interactive and movable. Full implementation with accurate visual representation scores 10 points.",

Check for smooth animation (60fps), precise positioning, proper z-index management, and intuitive interaction. Deduct 3 points if there's noticeable lag, 3 points if tool positioning is imprecise, and 4 points if tools can't be reliably manipulated. Full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the spread plate technique (e.g., unrelated biological processes) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that distract from learning).
