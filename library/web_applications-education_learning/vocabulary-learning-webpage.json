Score 0 if there's no vocabulary display functionality, 5 if only basic word display is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive vocabulary learning features (including word display, definitions, usage examples, and testing mechanisms) are included.",

Look for structured data organization (arrays/objects), potential for persistent storage (localStorage/IndexedDB), and efficient data loading mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if vocabulary is hardcoded with no data structure, 3 points if there's no mechanism to add new words. Award full 10 points for a well-structured data model with persistence capabilities.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to vocabulary learning (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core learning functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global variables are overused or if there's no separation of concerns; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no consideration for scalability or future enhancements.
