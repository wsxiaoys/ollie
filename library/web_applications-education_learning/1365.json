      "description": "Evaluate whether the content covers major automotive chip categories (e.g., MCU, SoC, ADAS processors, power management ICs, sensors). Check if the analysis includes key applications, technological trends, and market positioning of different chip types. Score 0 if only basic definitions are provided, 5 if common subdivisions are listed but lack depth, and 10 if comprehensive coverage with technical specifications and market contexts is included.",

Check if the document structure reflects the logical relationship between different chip categories and their applications. Deduct 5 points if the HTML lacks proper sectioning elements, 3 points if heading levels (h1-h6) are improperly nested, and 2 points if there's no clear content organization.

Evaluate if the chosen visualization methods effectively communicate complex chip industry information. Deduct 5 points if no visualization is included, 3 points if visualizations are present but don't add meaningful insight, and 2 points if the visualizations contain inaccurate data.

Verify CSS prefixing or feature detection for cross-browser compatibility. Deduct 5 points if responsive design is absent, 3 points if it's partially implemented but breaks at certain viewports, and 2 points if browser-specific issues aren't addressed.

Code with strong robustness should include error handling for API calls and graceful degradation. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic error checks, and 0 points if no exception handling is implemented.",

Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations, excessive DOM manipulation). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core information is obscured by redundant code.",
