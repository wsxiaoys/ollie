Check for Genshin's characteristic fantasy elements, elemental colors, and the distinctive UI patterns. Deduct 5 points if the color scheme contradicts the game's palette, 3 points if fonts don't reflect the game's style, and 5 points if no game-specific visual elements are incorporated.",

Check if images are optimized for different screen sizes and if interactive elements remain functional on touch devices.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
