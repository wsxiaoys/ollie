Evaluate support for different encodings (ASCII, UTF-16), font handling, and content streams interpretation. Deduct 3 points if text extraction is limited, 3 points if image extraction is missing, and 4 points if vector graphics rendering is incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper separation of concerns, composition functions, and dependency injection. Deduct 5 points for using Options API instead of Composition API, 3 points for mixing patterns inconsistently, and 3 points for not leveraging reactive primitives effectively.

Check for canvas-based rendering or DOM-based representation. Deduct 3 points if page navigation is missing, 3 points if zoom functionality is not implemented, 2 points if text selection is not supported, and 2 points if the rendering is not performant with larger documents.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to PDF handling (e.g., excessive animations unrelated to document viewing) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary 3D transforms for page turns).
