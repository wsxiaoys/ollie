Check if the code uses appropriate libraries (like docx.js, html-to-docx, or similar) with proper error handling. The exported Word document should maintain the structure, formatting, and completeness of the original checklist.

Check if it uses appropriate data structures (arrays, objects) that facilitate filtering, sorting, and categorization of security items. The implementation should demonstrate separation of data and presentation concerns. Deduct 5 points if the data is hardcoded directly in the HTML rather than stored in JavaScript variables/objects, 3 points if the structure doesn't allow for easy modification or extension of the checklist.
