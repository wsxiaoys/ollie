      "description": "Review whether the code includes the essential flashcard functions: adding cards, viewing cards, flipping/revealing answers, and marking cards as correct/incorrect. The implementation should handle different card types (text, images) and support basic styling. Score 0 if there's no functional review system, 5 if only basic text cards are supported, and 10 if it includes multiple card types with proper navigation.",

      "description": "Check if the application properly implements random, sequential, and reverse order card review modes. The random mode should use a proper randomization algorithm (not pseudo-random patterns), sequential should maintain deck order, and reverse should correctly invert the sequence. Deduct 3 points if any mode is missing, 5 points if the randomization has obvious patterns, and 3 points if mode switching causes state issues. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to flashcard review (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
