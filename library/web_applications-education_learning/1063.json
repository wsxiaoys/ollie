Check if elements are visually distinct with appropriate atomic number, symbol, name, and basic properties visible at a glance. Score 0 if the periodic table structure is incorrect or incomplete, 5 if the basic layout is present but has positioning errors, and 10 if the periodic table accurately represents the standard IUPAC periodic table layout.",

The filtering should be responsive and visually indicate which elements match the criteria.
