Design and Implementation of \"Star Trail\" App Based on WeChat Mini Program\n\nYou are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable whenever possible. This concerns the design and implementation of the \"Star Trail\" app based on WeChat Mini Program.\n\nThe app allows users to set habit goals (such as early rising, reading, exercising, etc.), check in daily to record completion status, generates habit formation progress charts, provides habit-related knowledge and tips, includes reminder functionality, and supports social sharing and friend interaction encouragement. Complete code required.",
