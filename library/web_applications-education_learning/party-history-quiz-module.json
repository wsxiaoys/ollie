Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration.

Check if the SQL script is executable and follows MySQL best practices with proper data types, constraints, and normalization. Score 0 if missing core tables, 5 if basic tables exist but lack optimization, 10 if fully optimized with comments and proper relationships.",

Verify MyBatis Plus is correctly configured with optimized SQL queries. Deduct 3 points for missing layers, 3 points for incomplete API endpoints, 4 points for missing authentication.

Check for type safety throughout the codebase without any 'any' types.

Function modules unrelated to Party history quiz (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations).
