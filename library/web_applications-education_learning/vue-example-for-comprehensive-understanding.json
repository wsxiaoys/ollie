      "description": "Check if the code clearly demonstrates Vue's core concepts: data binding, directives (v-if, v-for, v-model, v-on), computed properties, watchers, and lifecycle hooks. All fundamental concepts should be included with proper explanations. Score 10 points for comprehensive coverage, 5 points if only basic concepts are included, 0 if fundamental Vue features are missing.",

Deduct 2 points for each missing component interaction pattern. The full implementation should demonstrate at least 3 levels of component nesting with clear separation of concerns.",

The implementation should demonstrate lazy loading routes and route meta fields.

The code should show best practices for accessing store state, committing mutations, and dispatching actions. Look for module namespacing and proper separation of concerns.

Code with strong robustness should include try/catch blocks, form validation, and graceful error presentation.
