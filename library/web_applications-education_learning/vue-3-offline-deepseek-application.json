Deduct 3 points if using Options API without justification, 5 points if Vue 2 patterns are mixed in, and 5 points if component architecture is monolithic. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the application works completely offline after initial load. Deduct 5 points if Service Worker is missing, 3 points if offline state handling is incomplete, and 5 points if there are network dependencies not properly cached. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if model loading, initialization, and inference are handled efficiently.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
