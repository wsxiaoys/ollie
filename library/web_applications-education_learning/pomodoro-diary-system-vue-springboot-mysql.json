  "question": "You are a code expert. Please utilize your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Ensure that the code you generate is executable whenever possible. 2.2.1 Front-end Development Technology Overview:\n\n(1) WeChat Mini Program Development: As a lightweight application, WeChat Mini Programs allow users to directly use them within the WeChat environment without separate downloads. Developers can rely on the WeChat Mini Program framework, components, and APIs for efficient development, implementing interface construction and interactive functions. Through Mini Program development, users can conveniently perform campus second-hand transactions and life services operations within WeChat without switching to other applications.\n\nVue Framework Application: As a popular JavaScript framework, Vue is primarily used for creating user interfaces. Its application in web-based management system development enables developers to build interfaces quickly and efficiently. The Vue framework provides a series of components and directives that allow developers to easily implement various functions, while also offering reactive data binding and component-based development features, which are beneficial for code organization and maintenance. Now, based on the above content, please write about my Pomodoro diary system, which uses Vue, Spring Boot, and MySQL technologies.",

      "description": "Examine whether the code correctly implements core Pomodoro functionality: 25-minute work periods, 5-minute short breaks, 15-minute long breaks after 4 work sessions. Check for visual countdown timer, progress indicators, and customizable time settings. Score 0 if the core timing mechanism is absent, 5 if basic timing exists but lacks configurability, and 10 if the implementation includes sound notifications, visual progress tracking, and allows user customization of time intervals.",

      "description": "Verify that completed Pomodoro sessions automatically prompt for diary entries or task completion notes. The system should record timestamps, duration, associated tasks, and completion status. Check if users can add reflections on productivity or notes about the completed work. Deduct 5 points if diary entries aren't linked to Pomodoro sessions, 3 points if entries lack metadata like timestamps or categories. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if controllers handle Pomodoro sessions, diary entries, user authentication, and data analytics endpoints. API versioning and documentation should be present. Deduct 5 points for missing authentication middleware, 3 points for inconsistent endpoint design patterns, and 5 points for poor error handling. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if indexes are used for frequently queried fields, if normalization principles are followed, and if the schema supports analytics and reporting features. Deduct 5 points for missing foreign key relationships, 3 points for poor field type choices, and 5 points if data integrity constraints are inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the application maintains state during browser refreshes. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Pomodoro/diary functionality (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during focus time).
