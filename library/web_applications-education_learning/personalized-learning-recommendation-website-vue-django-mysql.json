Based on the content, help me build a personalized learning recommendation website powered by knowledge graphs from scratch, step by step. The frontend will use Vue, the backend will use the Django framework, and MySQL will serve as the database.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements knowledge graph data modeling through Vue.js frontend and Django backend, including node/edge relationships, graph traversal algorithms, and interactive visualization components. Check if D3.js or similar libraries are properly integrated for graph rendering. Score 0 if core graph structure is missing, 5 if only basic nodes/edges are displayed, and 10 if complete interactive knowledge graph with search, filtering, and relationship exploration is implemented.",

Check if user behavior tracking, learning path analysis, and preference modeling are implemented. Verify integration between Django models and recommendation logic. Deduct 5 points if only basic similarity matching is used, 3 points if real-time recommendation updates are missing. Full score requires sophisticated ML-based recommendations with A/B testing capability.",

Evaluate MySQL database schema design for users, learning materials, knowledge entities, and relationships. Deduct 5 points if API versioning is missing, 3 points if database indexing is inadequate. Requires proper CORS handling, authentication middleware, and optimized query performance.",

Code with strong robustness should include proper exception handling, input validation, and graceful degradation, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
