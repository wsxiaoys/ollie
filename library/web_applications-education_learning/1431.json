      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a comprehensive vocabulary learning system with word presentation, pronunciation, definition display, and interactive practice methods. Score 0 if the core vocabulary learning components are missing, 5 if only basic word display is implemented, and 10 if it includes multiple learning modes (flashcards, matching, spelling challenges, etc.) appropriate for fifth-grade level.",

Deduct 5 points if the game lacks progression mechanics, 3 points if there's no reward system, and 5 points if the difficulty is inappropriate for fifth-grade students. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the vocabulary content aligns with fifth-grade curriculum standards, includes appropriate difficulty progression, and offers contextual learning. Deduct 5 points if the vocabulary selection is random without educational planning, 3 points if words lack definitions or usage examples, and 5 points if the content doesn't support different learning styles.

Deduct 5 points if there's no persistent progress tracking, 3 points if feedback is generic rather than specific to the learner's performance, and 5 points if there's no visualization of progress.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as incorrect inputs, browser differences, unloaded resources, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Adaptive difficulty based on performance 3. Social learning components like class leaderboards). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Fancy effects that distract from learning or affect performance. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core learning functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if vocabulary data isn't externalized for easy updating.

Deduct 5 points for each interaction requiring fine motor skills beyond fifth-grade abilities, 3 points for delayed feedback that could confuse learners, and 5 points for lack of audio support for vocabulary learning.
