      "description": "Evaluate whether the code properly structures the wellness guide with clear section headings, proper hierarchical organization, and consistent formatting. Check if HTML semantic elements (header, section, article) are used appropriately, and if styling provides clear visual hierarchy between main sections, subsections, and content items. Score 0 if structure is chaotic, 5 if basic structure exists but lacks semantic HTML, 10 if fully organized with proper HTML5 semantic elements.",

      "description": "Check if the implementation includes interactive elements like checkboxes for daily wellness tasks, activity timers for the Arbor Day activities, or progress trackers for water consumption. Evaluate whether these elements store user progress (localStorage) and provide visual feedback when completed. Deduct 5 points if no interactive elements exist, 3 points if they exist but don't save user progress. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code implements date-aware content that recognizes the current date (relative to March 12, 2025) and adjusts recommendations accordingly. Check if there's a countdown to the special Arbor Day activity time window (3:00-5:00 PM) and notifications/reminders for optimal activities based on time of day.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as browser compatibility issues, offline usage, timezone differences affecting recommendations, incorrect user inputs) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to wellness guidance (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow loading).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
