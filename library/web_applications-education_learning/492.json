Check if it includes play/pause functionality, replay options, and speed control for different learning levels. Score 0 if audio playback is not implemented, 5 if basic playback exists but lacks controls, and 10 if the implementation includes advanced features like speed adjustment, section repeat, and proper error handling when audio fails to load.",

Function modules unrelated to language learning (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during typing).
