      "description": "Review whether the code correctly renders the MLP architecture through HTML/CSS/JavaScript, including input layer, hidden layers, and output layer with proper node representation. Check if neuron connections (weights) are visually displayed with appropriate styling. Score 0 if basic network structure is missing, 5 if only simple nodes are shown without connections, and 10 if complete MLP topology with weighted connections is accurately represented.",

Check if activation functions are visually represented and if the propagation timing is educational. Deduct 5 points if layer-by-layer processing is not shown, and 3 points if activation function visualization is missing. Full score requires clear step-by-step forward pass animation.",

Evaluate if mathematical formulas are displayed alongside animations. Deduct 5 points if weight multiplication is not visualized, 3 points if bias terms are ignored, and 5 points if activation functions lack mathematical representation. Full implementation scores 10 points.",

Check for features like play/pause, step-by-step mode, and parameter adjustment capabilities. Deduct 5 points if no user controls are provided, 3 points if explanatory text is insufficient, and 5 points if the learning progression is unclear.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Multiple dataset examples with different behaviors 3. Interactive weight adjustment sliders 4. Comparative visualization of different activation functions).

Function modules unrelated to MLP explanation (e.g., unrelated mathematical concepts) 3. Overly complex effects that distract from learning (e.g., excessive particle effects or decorative animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core educational purpose is interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or proper class/module structure is not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if inconsistent coding style is observed.
