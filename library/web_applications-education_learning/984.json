      "description": "Review whether the code accurately integrates a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, DarkSky, or WeatherAPI), includes proper error handling, caching for performance optimization, and displays comprehensive weather information (temperature, precipitation, forecast for multiple days). Score 0 if there's no API integration, 5 if only basic current weather is shown, and 10 if a comprehensive weather forecast with historical patterns and travel recommendations based on weather conditions is implemented.",

      "description": "Check whether the code correctly implements Amap JS API with proper authentication, map initialization, and marker management. Verify that the map provides essential functions like zooming, panning, and location search. Deduct 5 points if the map lacks responsive design for different screen sizes, 3 points if proper error handling for API failures is missing, and 2 points if the map styling doesn't match the overall application design.

Check if the implementation includes estimated travel time, distance calculation, and turn-by-turn directions. Deduct 5 points if only simple point-to-point routing exists, 3 points if alternative routes aren't provided, and 2 points if the route visualization is poor. Full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points if POI data is hardcoded rather than fetched from an API, 4 points if POI details lack depth, and 3 points if there's no way to search or filter POIs. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to travel guides (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down map rendering). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.

Deduct 3 points for cluttered UI elements, 5 points for poor contrast making text unreadable on map, and 5 points for non-responsive design. The full score is 10 points.",
