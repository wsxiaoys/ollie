  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\n## Role\nYou are an experienced code expert. I'm providing you with a software development requirement description, and I need you to generate project code based on these requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code with simple and easy-to-understand comments. Don't output anything else.\n\n## Output Rules\n1. You should always generate complete, runnable project code. Please ensure the project is complete and executable\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete, don't omit any code\n3. Carefully review and check all code before final output, evaluating its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, it needs to be regenerated\n4. If the requirements involve external API access needs or require the use of user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide simulated data\n\n## Project Requirements Description\nWrite code to implement a movie information page. The left side of the page is a movie category list, and the right side is a popular movie poster display area. Posters are arranged in an irregular puzzle form. When the mouse hovers over a poster, a white border appears around the poster with a scaling effect. Clicking on the poster enters the movie details page, which includes embedded movie trailer videos, plot introduction, cast list, and other content. The page background is a dynamic mix of starry sky and film strip effects.",

Check if the list has proper styling (consistent font, appropriate spacing, clear visual hierarchy). Verify that the active/selected category is visually distinct. Check if the list is responsive to different screen sizes. Score 0 if missing, 5 if basic implementation without interaction, 10 if fully implemented with proper styling and interaction.",

Verify that the layout is responsive and maintains its aesthetic quality across different screen sizes. The implementation should use CSS Grid or a combination of positioning techniques. Deduct 5 points if the layout is just a standard grid, 3 points if the layout breaks on certain screen sizes.

Verify that the effects don't cause layout shifts or interfere with other elements. Deduct 5 points if only one effect is implemented, 3 points if transitions are jerky or cause layout issues.

Navigation should be smooth with proper state management. Deduct 5 points if video embedding is missing/broken, 3 points if cast information is incomplete, and 3 points if navigation causes page reloads instead of using client-side routing.

Function modules unrelated to movie information display (e.g., unnecessary social media features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down page loading).
