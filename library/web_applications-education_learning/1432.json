Score 0 if these core components are missing, 5 if basic functionality exists with limitations, and 10 if the system has comprehensive question types (multiple choice, text input, matching, etc.) with proper validation logic for each type.",

Deduct 5 points if the validation is too strict or too lenient, 3 points if it lacks feedback on why an answer is incorrect. Give 10 points for sophisticated validation with partial credit capabilities.",

Check if it shows the student's answer alongside the correct answer with appropriate explanations. Deduct 5 points if only basic compilation exists without categorization, 3 points if it lacks visual distinction between correct/incorrect portions of answers. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the assignment system (e.g., unnecessary animations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy graphics that slow loading times). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
