  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. I want to create a web-based real-time bus inquiry function, with routes, stops, and real-time data obtained from Gaode Maps or Chelaile. The frontend will be implemented using HTML+CSS+JS, and the backend will use Python. Please organize the complete code for all required pages and send them to me. If there's anything I need to replace, please let me know.",

Verify that the frontend handles user queries and the backend properly integrates with Gaode Maps or Chelaile APIs. Score 0 if core inquiry function is missing, 5 if only basic route display is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive real-time tracking is fully implemented.",

Check for proper API key management (not hardcoded in frontend). Deduct 3 points if API keys are exposed, 3 points if error handling is inadequate, and 4 points if the integration lacks proper documentation or is incomplete.

Check for update frequency balance (not too frequent to overload APIs, not too slow to be outdated). Deduct 5 points if updates are manual-only, 3 points if the mechanism creates unnecessary API calls, and 2 points if there's no visual indication of data freshness.

Verify permissions handling and fallbacks when location access is denied. Deduct 4 points if location accuracy is poor, 3 points if there's no permission handling, and 3 points if the system doesn't provide alternative manual location input methods.

Function modules unrelated to bus inquiry (e.g., unnecessary weather widgets) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down critical information display).
