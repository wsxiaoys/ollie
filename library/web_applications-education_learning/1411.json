How do I create an app for practicing new vocabulary words from the \"Reading and Writing\" section at the end of each lesson in the 8th grade second semester Chinese Language Arts textbook (non-provincial edition)?",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a database/storage system for vocabulary words, with proper categorization by textbook lessons. Check if it includes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for words, definitions, and example sentences. Score 0 if core vocabulary storage is not implemented, 5 if basic storage exists without lesson organization, and 10 if complete vocabulary management with lesson-based organization is implemented.",

Check if the implementation follows spaced repetition principles and adapts to the student's performance. Deduct 3 points if spaced repetition is missing, 3 points if there are fewer than 3 practice modes, and 2 points if performance tracking is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if it allows navigation between lessons, tracking completion rates, and provides lesson-specific statistics. Deduct 5 points if lessons cannot be individually selected, 3 points if progress tracking per lesson is missing, and 2 points if there's no visual indication of lesson completion status.

Score should reflect implementation of learning curves, mistake frequency analysis, and time-based performance metrics.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Handwriting recognition for character practice 3. Contextual usage examples from real texts 4. Gamification elements that motivate continued learning). Add 2.5 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Fancy effects that affect performance or distract from learning. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core learning functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation between UI and business logic.
