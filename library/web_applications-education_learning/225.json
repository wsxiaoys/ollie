Form submission should prevent multiple submissions and display loading states. Deduct 3 points if validation is missing, 2 points if error handling is poor, and 2 points if the UI is not responsive.

Check for input sanitization to prevent XSS, rate limiting for login attempts, and proper error logging. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
