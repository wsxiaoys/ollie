Develop a programming knowledge learning tool that displays HTML/CSS/JavaScript concepts, with a real-time editing area below that allows users to input code and see the results (such as generated HTML structures or CSS styles) previewed immediately alongside.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements a seamless real-time preview system that updates as users type, with minimal delay (<100ms). Check for proper event listeners (e.g., 'input' events), debounce mechanisms for performance, and accurate rendering of HTML/CSS/JavaScript results. Score 0 if preview is not implemented, 5 if basic preview exists but has significant delay/bugs, 10 if preview works flawlessly with immediate feedback.",

Check for inclusion of basic concepts (e.g., HTML structure, CSS selectors, JavaScript variables) and advanced topics (e.g., CSS grid, JavaScript promises).

Examine whether it supports multiple language modes (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) with appropriate highlighting for each. Deduct 3 points if syntax highlighting is missing, 2 points for lack of line numbers, 2 points for no auto-indentation, and 3 points if language switching is not supported or buggy.

Verify that errors are displayed in a user-friendly manner with appropriate highlighting of problematic code sections. Look for features like console output integration and debugging hints.

Code with strong robustness should use sandboxing techniques like iframes with proper security attributes or Web Workers for JavaScript execution. Give 10 points for comprehensive protection, 5 points for basic safeguards, and 0 points if no protection mechanisms exist.",

Function modules unrelated to code learning (e.g., built-in games unrelated to programming) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that distract from learning).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if appropriate design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation of concerns between different functional components.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for poor contrast between code and instructions, and 5 points for chaotic layout that hampers the learning experience.
