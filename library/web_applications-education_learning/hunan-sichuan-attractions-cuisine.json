      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements tourist attraction data display through HTML/JavaScript, including attraction details, geographic location, opening hours, ticket prices, and user ratings. Check if interactive maps are integrated and whether attraction filtering/searching functionality is provided. Score 0 if core attraction display is not implemented, 5 if only basic information is shown, and 10 if comprehensive attraction management with interactive features is fully included.",

Check if recipe details, restaurant locations, price ranges, and user reviews are implemented. Verify if cuisine categorization and recommendation algorithms are present. Deduct 5 points if recipe details are missing, and 3 points if restaurant information is incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the data structure efficiently organizes tourist and cuisine information using appropriate data models (JSON/database schema). Check if content management allows for easy updates, additions, and modifications of attractions and restaurants. Evaluate if search indexing and data relationships are properly established. Deduct 5 points if data structure is poorly designed, and 3 points if content management is not scalable. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if social sharing capabilities, photo galleries, and virtual tours are implemented. Verify if user preferences and personalized recommendations are supported. Deduct 5 points if basic interaction features are missing, and 3 points if user engagement tools are incomplete. Give 10 points if fully implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as missing data, network interruption, invalid user input, image loading failures, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Real-time weather integration 4. Multi-language support 5. Offline map functionality). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to tourism/cuisine (e.g., built-in games or music players) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or heavy graphics). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if the file structure is poorly organized.

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for visual artifacts during interactions, and 5 points for hard-to-find navigation elements. The full score is 10 points.",
