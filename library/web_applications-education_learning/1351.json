      "description": "Check whether the code correctly implements the basic form elements using native WeChat Mini Program components (input, picker, slider, etc.) for collecting industry type, room dimensions, and height. Verify that proper WXML structure, WXSS styling, and JS event handling are included. Score 0 if the core form elements are missing, 5 if basic implementation exists but lacks validation, and 10 if the form is complete with proper data binding and validation.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes algorithms to calculate appropriate lighting solutions based on the input parameters (industry type, room dimensions, height). Check for industry-specific lighting standards implementation, lux level calculations, fixture quantity recommendations, and positioning suggestions. Deduct 5 points if the calculation lacks industry standards reference, and 3 points if it only provides basic calculations without optimization. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code provides visual feedback of the lighting design through canvas, SVG, or other WeChat Mini Program compatible visualization methods. The visualization should accurately represent the room dimensions and proposed lighting fixtures placement. Deduct 5 points if there's no real-time preview, 3 points if the visualization is static and non-interactive. Give 10 points if the visualization is interactive and updates with input changes.",

      "description": "Check if the code implements proper data management including local storage for saving user inputs, cloud data integration if applicable, and proper state management between pages. Verify that the app can restore previous inputs when reopened. Deduct 5 points if there's no data persistence, 3 points if state management between components is inconsistent.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid inputs, out-of-range values, permission denials, network issues, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Cost estimation based on fixture selection). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to lighting design (e.g., unrelated social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow down the app). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if the code doesn't follow the WeChat Mini Program development conventions; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no proper error handling and logging.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the overall design follows WeChat Mini Program design guidelines: 1) Harmonious color matching consistent with lighting industry aesthetics 2) Proper layout spacing following WeChat's component spacing principles 3) Professional typography system that ensures readability. Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for inappropriate color schemes that harm readability, and 5 points for layouts that break on different screen sizes.

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for lagging transitions when changing inputs, and 5 points for confusing navigation patterns. The full score is 10 points.",
