      "description": "Check if the code implements the core Jupyter notebook components: cells (code, markdown), cell execution counter, toolbar, and menu bar. Score 0 if essential components are missing, 5 if basic components are present but lack proper styling or hierarchy, and 10 if the structure closely resembles an actual Jupyter notebook with proper component organization.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements different cell types with appropriate editors and renderers. Code cells should have syntax highlighting, markdown cells should render formatted text, and there should be UI to switch between cell types. Deduct 3 points if syntax highlighting is missing, 4 points if markdown rendering is incorrect, and 5 points if cell type switching is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the React implementation includes a mechanism to simulate code execution (even if through mock data or simple JavaScript evaluation). The implementation should show execution status (running/completed), display output (text, graphs, tables), and handle execution errors. Deduct 5 points if execution status indicators are missing, and 5 points if output rendering is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Each missing function deducts 2.5 points. Check if keyboard shortcuts are implemented for these operations (an additional 2.5 points for complete shortcuts). The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If error handling is basic, give 5 points, and if no error handling exists, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Jupyter notebooks (e.g., unrelated dashboard elements) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
