This is an illustration from the Chinese literature lesson on \"Lisao\" (The Lament). I need you to create a webpage based on this image with the following requirements:\n- Transform the image into a dynamic video, adding details from the text\n- Generate a synchronized audio narration file that plays with the video, with the narration content providing supplementary knowledge about \"Lisao\" not covered in the lesson",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the HTML structure follows semantic markup principles with proper use of <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer> tags. Check for responsive design implementation with appropriate meta viewport tags and CSS media queries. Score 0 if basic HTML structure is missing, 5 if basic structure exists but lacks semantic elements, 10 if fully compliant with HTML5 standards including accessible attributes.",

      "description": "Review whether the code effectively transforms the static image into a dynamic video with animated elements. Check if it uses canvas manipulation, SVG animations, or HTML5 video elements with proper layering. Score 0 if no animation exists, 5 if basic animation is implemented but lacks smoothness or detail, 10 if the animation is fluid with multiple animated elements that accurately represent scenes from 'Lisao'.",

Check for symbolic elements (like herbs, mythical creatures, or celestial journeys mentioned in the poem), accurate historical context visualization, and visual storytelling elements. Deduct 3 points for each major textual element missing, and 5 points if the visuals contradict the poem's content. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the code includes timestamp markers for synchronization points, event listeners for coordinating audio with visual elements, and proper preloading of audio resources. Score 0 if no synchronization exists, 5 if basic synchronization is implemented but with noticeable lag, 10 if perfect synchronization with visual cues matching narration content.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Parallax scrolling effects tied to poem progression 3. Cultural context tooltips appearing alongside narration). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to the poem presentation (e.g., unrelated social media widgets) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects causing lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core presentation is interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global variable pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance considerations (like image optimization or lazy loading) are implemented.

Deduct 5 points for jarring transitions, 3 points for animations that run too quickly to appreciate, and 5 points for confusing navigation or lack of user control options (pause/play/rewind).
