A complete implementation plan for an interactive JavaScript-based tourism app backend code explanation system, with a duration of 8 minutes, operated in VSCode editor, including code demonstrations, real-time interaction, and visual explanation features: requires complete runtime environment configuration or specific functionality extension details.",

      "description": "Review whether the code provides a complete backend explanation system including data models, API endpoints, authentication mechanisms, and database connections. Check if the system has proper MVC/MVVM architecture and RESTful API design. Score 0 if core backend functions are missing, 5 if basic CRUD operations are implemented, and 10 if it includes comprehensive tourism-specific backend functionality (user profiles, booking systems, location services, etc.).",

Check if custom snippets, keyboard shortcuts, or debugging profiles are provided for tourism app development. Deduct 3 points if VSCode-specific features are not utilized, 3 points if debugging configurations are missing, and 4 points if there's no consideration for team collaboration settings.

Check if demonstration checkpoints or commented code sections are included to guide the presenter. Deduct 5 points if the demonstration structure is missing, 3 points if timing is unrealistic for code complexity. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the visualization updates in real-time with backend operations. Deduct 5 points if visualizations are static, 3 points if real-time updates are limited to simple metrics. Add 3 points for innovative visual metaphors specific to tourism contexts (e.g., map-based data flow visualization). The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should include proper error handling, logging, transaction management, and graceful degradation. Give 10 points if comprehensive error handling is implemented, 5 points if basic exception handling exists, and 0 points if no error handling is present.",

Function modules unrelated to tourism backend explanation (e.g., unrelated frontend components) 3. Resource-intensive visualizations that affect demonstration performance. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
