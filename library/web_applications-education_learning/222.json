      "title": "Is the weather data fetching and integration functionality complete?",
      "description": "Review whether the code connects to a reliable weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.), implements proper API key management, and includes error handling. Check if the request includes geolocation capabilities and fallback mechanisms. Score 0 if no data fetching is implemented, 5 if basic fetching exists but lacks error handling, and 10 if complete with robust error handling, caching strategy and data refresh mechanisms.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the mini-program displays current conditions, hourly forecasts, and multi-day forecasts with appropriate weather metrics (temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, precipitation probability, etc.). Check if weather icons/symbols are properly implemented and if temperature units can be toggled (°C/°F). Deduct 3 points if critical metrics are missing, 5 points if only current weather is shown without forecasts, and 2 points if weather condition icons are missing or inappropriate. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Are geolocation features implemented properly?",
      "description": "Check if the code implements browser geolocation API or IP-based geolocation, with appropriate permission requests and user-friendly error handling. Verify if manual location search functionality is available as an alternative. Score 0 if no location detection exists, 5 if only basic geolocation is implemented without alternatives, and 10 if both automatic and manual location options are available with proper error handling and location history/favorites.",

      "description": "Assess whether the mini-program includes visual representations like temperature trend graphs, precipitation probability charts, or other meteorological visualizations using appropriate JavaScript libraries (Chart.js, D3.js, etc.). Score 0 if no visual elements are included, 5 if basic static visualizations exist, and 10 if interactive, responsive visualizations with proper legends and accessibility features are implemented.",

      "title": "Is the code robust?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as API failures, network interruption, geolocation errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Weather-based clothing recommendations 4. Historical weather data comparison). Add 2.5 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant API calls or data fetching mechanisms 2. Function modules unrelated to weather forecasting (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 3 points if the code duplication rate is too high; deduct 2 points if there's no input validation or sanitization.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the overall design follows modern weather app design principles: 1) Weather-appropriate color schemes (cool tones for cold, warm for hot) 2) Proper layout spacing and hierarchy (important data more prominent) 3) Professional typography system (readable even with weather imagery backgrounds). Deduct 3 points for cluttered layouts, 4 points for poor contrast/readability, and 3 points for inconsistent design elements. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 4 points for lack of loading indicators, 3 points for janky scrolling or transitions, and 3 points for poor mobile optimization. The full score is 10 points.",
