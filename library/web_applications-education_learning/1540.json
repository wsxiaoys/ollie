Be sure to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration purposes. I've created a frontend-backend separated project in IntelliJ IDEA with Vue for the frontend and SSM for the backend. Please implement the complete code for a music player that can read and play MP3 files from a local folder, and specify which code should be created in which folder.",

      "description": "Review whether the backend code properly implements file system scanning for MP3 files, handling file metadata extraction (ID3 tags), and provides a well-designed API for the frontend to access. Check for proper error handling for invalid files, large directories, and potential security issues. Score 0 if file scanning is not implemented, 5 if only basic file listing is available, and 10 if complete metadata extraction and efficient file handling are included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the Vue frontend implements all necessary playback functions: play, pause, stop, seek, volume control, and track navigation. The component should handle audio state management correctly and provide visual feedback on the current playback state. Deduct 3 points if seeking functionality is missing, 3 points for missing volume controls, and 5 points if playback state management is buggy. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the SSM backend provides proper RESTful APIs for file access and streaming, with appropriate error handling, caching strategies, and security measures. Evaluate if the Vue frontend correctly communicates with these endpoints using axios or similar libraries, with proper loading states and error handling. Deduct 5 points if streaming is inefficient (loading entire MP3 files at once), 3 points for missing error handling, and 3 points for not implementing proper cache controls.

Check if the player implements a playlist view, album artwork display, and track information panel.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as missing files, corrupted MP3s, network interruption, user operation errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to music playing (e.g., a built-in calendar) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the UI). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
