      "title": "Is the memo functionality fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code implements complete memo functionality including creating, editing, saving, and deleting memos. Check for proper text formatting options, search functionality, and categorization features. Score 0 if the basic memo operations are missing, 5 if only rudimentary operations exist, and 10 if all expected features of a modern memo application are present.",

      "title": "Is the audio playback integration complete?",
      "description": "Evaluate the audio playback implementation including controls (play, pause, stop, seek), support for common audio formats (MP3, WAV, OGG), volume adjustment, and playback rate control. Check if proper error handling for unsupported formats or playback failures exists. Deduct 3 points if basic playback controls are missing, 3 points if format support is limited, and 4 points if error handling is inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Does the application handle audio recording capabilities?",
      "description": "Check whether the application allows users to record audio directly within the memo interface, including microphone access permissions handling, recording indicators, and saving recorded audio with the memo. Verify that the recording quality options are available and that recordings can be edited/trimmed before saving. Deduct 5 points if recording functionality is missing, 3 points if quality control is absent, and 2 points if editing capabilities are not provided. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Is proper audio-text association implemented?",
      "description": "Assess whether the application effectively links audio files with the corresponding memo text, such as timestamps for audio references in text, visual indicators for audio attachments, and the ability to navigate text while audio plays. Check for synchronization between text edits and associated audio. Deduct 4 points if audio-text linking is absent, 3 points if visual indicators are missing, and 3 points if navigation during playback isn't supported. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as audio format incompatibility, recording permission denials, storage limitations, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Audio visualization during playback 4. AI-powered audio summarization). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple audio playback engines coexisting) 2. Function modules unrelated to memo or audio purposes (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during audio playback). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

      "description": "Review modular design (such as separating memo logic/audio handling/UI layers), unit test coverage, and build process automation. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the overall design follows modern design principles: 1) Harmonious color matching (no more than 3 primary colors) 2) Proper layout spacing (element spacing follows the 8px multiple principle) 3) Professional font system (body font size ≥ 14px, line height over 1.5 times). Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",

Assess audio-specific interactions such as waveform responsiveness and playback progress indicators. Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for visual after-images during fast sliding, and 5 points for hard-to-find key function buttons. The full score is 10 points.",
