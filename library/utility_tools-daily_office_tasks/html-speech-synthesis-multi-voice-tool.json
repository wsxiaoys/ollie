      "description": "Evaluate whether the code provides a comprehensive voice selection interface that allows users to select from all available system voices. Check if the voices are properly categorized by language and if there's a preview option. Score 0 if voice selection is missing, 5 if only basic voice listing is implemented, 10 if full voice selection with filtering and categorization is included.",

Check if the synthesis can be started, paused, resumed, and stopped. Deduct 5 points if pitch/rate controls are missing, and 3 points if volume control is not implemented.

Check if the implementation allows users to save or load text. Deduct 3 points if there's no character count, 3 points if special characters cause issues, and 5 points if long text handling is problematic. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if parameters can be adjusted in real-time and if there are presets for common scenarios.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to speech synthesis (e.g., a built-in music player) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
