      "description": "Check if the code uses a reliable PDF rendering library (like PDF.js) that correctly displays PDFs in Vue 2. Verify that the PDF is properly loaded, displayed with correct dimensions, and supports different zoom levels. Score 0 if PDF rendering is not implemented, 5 if basic display works but lacks zoom/navigation features, and 10 if fully implemented with proper error handling for corrupt files.",

Check if positioning is accurate and if editing capabilities respect field constraints (e.g., max characters, numerical validation). Deduct 3 points if signature fields aren't supported, 2 points if field validation is missing, and 2 points if field formatting options are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper reactivity, whether updates in Vue models reflect immediately in the PDF and vice versa. Deduct 5 points if binding is one-way only, 3 points if there are noticeable update delays, and 5 points if the binding breaks when handling complex field interactions. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to PDF form filling (e.g., a built-in file explorer) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations when filling forms).
