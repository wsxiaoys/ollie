  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration purposes. Develop code for a screenshot tool that allows users to capture browser areas through simple button triggers, supporting three modes: selected area, current visible window, and entire webpage. Users should be able to perform simple edits on the screenshots (such as adding text, drawing boxes, marking with arrows). Finally, users should be able to save the screenshot as an image format and download it quickly.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements all three required screenshot modes (selected area, current visible window, and entire webpage). Check if the selection mechanism for the 'selected area' mode allows for precise rectangular selections with visual feedback. Score 0 if no capture functionality works, 5 if only some modes are implemented, and 10 if all three modes work correctly with proper user feedback.",

Check if the text tool supports font customization, if rectangle drawing allows for different colors/sizes, and if arrow markers can be properly positioned and oriented. Deduct 3 points if any required tool is missing, 2 points if a tool lacks essential customization options, and 5 points if the edit interface is not intuitive. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the download process initiates promptly, uses appropriate file naming conventions, and preserves image quality.

Check if appropriate fallbacks or guidance is provided when permissions are denied or features are unsupported. Deduct 5 points if the tool only works in one specific browser, 3 points if permission handling is inadequate, and 5 points if there's no error handling for unsupported scenarios.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to screenshot capture and editing (e.g., built-in image gallery) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations during capture).
