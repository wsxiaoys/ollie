      "description": "Check if the code utilizes an appropriate QR code scanning library (like jsQR, quagga.js, or ZXing) and properly integrates with the device camera API. The implementation should include proper initialization of the camera stream, frame analysis for QR detection, and accurate decoding. Score 0 if no scanner is implemented, 5 if basic scanning works but with limitations, and 10 if it handles different QR code formats and scanning scenarios efficiently.",

Check if it supports both front and rear cameras with a toggle option. Deduct 5 points if permissions are not handled properly or if the code crashes when permissions are denied. Deduct 3 points if there's no camera selection option. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the code provides multiple options for saving scanned QR data (e.g., copy to clipboard, download as file, save to browser storage, share via API). Verify that the data saving process includes validation and handles different data types appropriately. The implementation should confirm successful saves with user feedback. Deduct 5 points if only one saving method is implemented without error handling, and 3 points if there's no confirmation of successful saves. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if there's a clear way to view scan details with timestamps and categories. Deduct 5 points if history doesn't persist between sessions, and 3 points if basic management features are missing. Give 10 points if fully implemented with search/filter capabilities.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to QR scanning or data saving (e.g., unnecessary social media sharing) 3. Fancy effects that affect scanning performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down camera processing). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
