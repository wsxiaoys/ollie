Try to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\n## Role\nYou are an experienced code expert. Given a software development requirement description, you are required to generate project code based on the project requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code with simple and easy-to-understand comments, and don't output anything else.\n\n## Output Rules\n1. You will always generate complete, runnable project code; please ensure the project is fully executable\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete, don't omit any code\n3. Carefully review and check all code before final output, evaluating its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, regenerate it\n4. If the requirements include external API access or user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide mock data\n\n## Project Requirements Description\nDevelop a screenshot and annotation tool where users can take screenshots of the current webpage through a browser or upload images, then add annotations such as text, arrows, shapes, etc. on the screenshot. The tool should support undo and redo functions, save edited images locally or to the cloud, and provide features for sharing to social media.",
