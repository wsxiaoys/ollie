The guide should include how to formulate the prompt, what information to provide, and how to iterate on responses. Deduct 5 points if Deepseek-specific guidance is missing, and 3 points if the instructions are too technical for a novice. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Examine whether the code allows users to record date, time, duration, and intensity of sunlight exposure in an intuitive way. Check if data validation is implemented (preventing invalid dates, negative durations, etc.).

Charts should show trends over time with proper labeling. Deduct 5 points if visualizations are missing, 3 points if they lack interactivity, and 2 points if they're not intuitive.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to sunlight recording (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if the code is overly complex for a novice to understand; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build/deployment process requires advanced technical knowledge.
