      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements clock-in/clock-out functionality through uni-app framework, including time recording, attendance status management, and local storage persistence. Score 0 if core clock-in logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic time recording is present, and 10 if complete attendance tracking with validation is included.",

Evaluate if uni-app specific APIs (uni.getLocation, uni.getStorage, etc.) are correctly integrated. Deduct 5 points if component communication is poorly implemented, and 3 points if lifecycle hooks are misused. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to attendance (e.g., built-in games or social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animation libraries).
