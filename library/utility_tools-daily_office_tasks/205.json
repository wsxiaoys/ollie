      "description": "Review whether the component follows Vue 2 best practices (proper use of props, data, computed properties, watch, methods, lifecycle hooks). Check if the component is registered correctly either globally or locally. Verify the component has clear single responsibility. Score 0 if Vue 2 syntax is incorrect, 5 if basic structure exists but with architectural flaws, and 10 if the component follows Vue 2 architecture patterns properly.",

Check if data organization allows for easy lookups, filtering, and modifications.

Verify that the component properly uses v-model or equivalent two-way binding when necessary, and utilizes Vue's reactivity features (computed properties, watchers) appropriately. Deduct 5 points if reactivity breaks during complex operations, 3 points if unnecessary deep watchers are used affecting performance. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to dictionary management 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations when displaying dictionary data).
