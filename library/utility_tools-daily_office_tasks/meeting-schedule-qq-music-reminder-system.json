  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable whenever possible. Help me write a simple software code for a meeting schedule recording reminder system that allows users to input schedule arrangements and dates. When the reminder button is clicked, on the corresponding date, the interface will automatically open QQ Music to play \"Today Is a Good Day.\" When the stop button is clicked, QQ Music will exit and the music will stop playing.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements schedule input functionality through HTML forms/JavaScript, including date picker, time selector, and schedule description fields. Check if data validation is implemented (date format, required fields, conflict detection). Score 0 if basic input functionality is missing, 5 if only simple input is implemented without validation, and 10 if complete input system with validation and local storage is included.",

      "description": "Check whether the reminder system uses appropriate timing mechanisms (setTimeout/setInterval) to monitor scheduled dates and times. Evaluate if the system can handle multiple concurrent reminders and accurately trigger at specified times. Deduct 5 points if timing accuracy is poor (>30 seconds deviation), and 3 points if background timing doesn't work when browser tab is inactive. Full score is 10 points.",

Check if the code uses appropriate methods (shell commands, registry, or protocol handlers) to open and close QQ Music. Verify if the specific song 'Today Is a Good Day' can be automatically played. Deduct 5 points if only basic app launch is implemented without specific song control, and 3 points if the stop functionality doesn't properly terminate the music application.",

Evaluate if the system maintains proper state tracking for active/inactive reminders and handles reminder history. Deduct 5 points if reminder persistence is not implemented, and 3 points if there's no mechanism to handle missed or expired reminders. Give 10 points if fully implemented with comprehensive state management.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to meeting reminders (e.g., built-in games or weather widgets) 3. Overly complex animations that affect performance (e.g., excessive visual effects during reminder triggers).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or proper separation of concerns is not implemented; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no configuration management is implemented for external application paths.
