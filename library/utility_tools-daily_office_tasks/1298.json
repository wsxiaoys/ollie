I want to create a WeChat Mini Program that will show public restrooms near the user's current location and mark them on Tencent Maps. Please write the entire project code using uniapp and following Vue 3's Composition API structure.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly uses the WeChat location API to obtain the user's current location, and then fetches nearby public restroom data. Check if the Tencent Maps integration correctly displays restroom locations with appropriate markers. Score 0 if location services are not implemented, 5 if basic location retrieval works but lacks error handling, and 10 if the implementation includes permission handling, location refresh mechanisms, and accurate geolocation conversion.",

The map should respond to user interactions like zooming, panning, and tapping on markers. Deduct 5 points if the map fails to properly render markers, 3 points if custom styling is missing, and 2 points if info windows don't provide useful information about restrooms.

Check for proper component organization, reusable composables, and adherence to Vue 3 best practices. Deduct 5 points if the code mixes Options API with Composition API, 5 points if reactive state management is poorly implemented, and 3 points if lifecycle hooks are improperly used.

Check for correct manifest.json configuration, proper use of uniapp's API (instead of direct WeChat API where applicable), and compatible component usage. Deduct 5 points if WeChat Mini Program specific configurations are missing, 3 points if platform detection is poor, and 5 points if uniapp APIs are bypassed in favor of direct platform APIs without justification.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to restroom finding (e.g., weather forecasts) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or complex UI transitions).

Deduct 5 points if global state management is poorly implemented; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the project structure is chaotic or if naming conventions are inconsistent.
