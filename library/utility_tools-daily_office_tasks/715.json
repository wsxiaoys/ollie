Check that window creation includes proper configuration options (width, height, webPreferences, etc.). Verify that both windows load the appropriate Vue components/pages. Score 0 if only one window is implemented, 5 if basic window creation exists but lacks proper configuration, and 10 if dual windows are fully implemented with appropriate lifecycle management.",
