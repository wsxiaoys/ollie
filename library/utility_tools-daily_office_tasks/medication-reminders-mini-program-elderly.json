      "title": "Is the medication reminder core functionality fully implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements essential medication reminder features: scheduling reminders, setting medication details (name, dosage, frequency), notification system, and acknowledgment of taken medication. Score 0 if core functionality is missing, 5 if basic reminders are implemented without flexibility, and 10 if the system includes multiple scheduling options (daily, weekly, specific times) with medication details management.",

      "title": "Is the elderly user interface properly designed for accessibility?",
      "description": "Check if the UI follows elderly-friendly design principles: large text (at least 16px), high contrast colors (contrast ratio ≥ 7:1), simplified navigation, clear buttons (minimum 44x44px touch targets), and minimal steps to complete tasks. Deduct 3 points for each accessibility guideline violated. Award full points only if the interface demonstrates specific considerations for elderly users including font scaling options.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code implements caregiver monitoring capabilities: missed medication alerts, medication adherence tracking, remote monitoring dashboard, and emergency contact integration. Deduct 3 points if remote monitoring is missing, 3 points if adherence tracking is absent, and 4 points if emergency contact functionality is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the code properly handles data storage (local storage or database implementation), synchronization mechanisms, and offline functionality. Check for proper data validation, backup mechanisms, and recovery procedures. Deduct 5 points if medication data isn't persistent after app restart, and 5 points if the app requires constant internet connection to function. Full score for complete offline capability with data integrity protection.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as incorrect inputs, network interruption, system notifications being blocked, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Adaptive reminder timing based on user habits 4. Gamification elements for medication adherence). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to medication reminders (e.g., a built-in games section) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that might confuse elderly users). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for confusing transitions, and 5 points for hard-to-find key function buttons. The full score is 10 points.",
