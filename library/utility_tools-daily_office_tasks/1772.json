      "description": "Review whether the code implements a complete date range selection interface with start and end date inputs, a calendar picker, and clear visual indicators of the selected range. Score 0 if there's no visual representation, 5 points if basic input fields are provided without a calendar, and 10 points if a full interactive calendar with range highlighting is implemented.",

      "description": "Check if the code includes validation for: invalid dates (e.g., February 30), ensuring end date is after start date, handling different date formats, timezone considerations, and preventing selection of invalid ranges (e.g., weekends/holidays if specified). Deduct 2 points for each missing validation aspect. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points if date arithmetic is incorrect, 3 points if formatting is inconsistent, and 4 points if timezone issues are ignored. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Functionality unrelated to date selection (e.g., unnecessary animations) 3. Overcomplicated UI that affects usability. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if browser compatibility is not considered.
