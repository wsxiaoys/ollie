Check if the 'src' prop is correctly defined with appropriate type validation and default values. Score 0 if basic Vue component structure is missing, 5 if component is defined but lacks proper prop validation, and 10 if all Vue 2 best practices are followed including proper prop types, validators, and component naming conventions.",

Check if the component handles different file types, cross-origin scenarios, and fallback mechanisms for unsupported browsers. Deduct 5 points if download attribute is missing, 3 points if cross-origin downloads aren't handled, and 2 points if file extension detection is not implemented.

Check if the component provides visual feedback during download initiation and handles multiple rapid clicks appropriately. Deduct 5 points if click events aren't properly bound, 3 points if no loading state is shown, and 2 points if rapid clicking causes multiple downloads without prevention.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like malformed URLs, CORS issues, and unsupported file types, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to downloading (e.g., built-in file preview, unnecessary animations) 3. Over-engineered solutions for simple requirements.

Deduct 5 points if Vue reactivity is misused or component lifecycle isn't properly managed; deduct 3 points if props aren't validated; deduct 2 points if event listeners aren't cleaned up.
