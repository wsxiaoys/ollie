      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the random name selection algorithm, including proper randomization, no repetition of selected names (unless reset), and visual indication of the currently selected name. Score 0 if the selection logic is not implemented, 5 if basic selection exists but has flaws, and 10 if the selection is truly random with proper visual feedback.",

Deduct 5 points if only CSV is supported but not Excel, 3 points if the parsing is buggy, and 2 points if there's no validation feedback. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the three buttons work as expected: start initiates the selection animation, pause freezes the current selection, and reset clears the selection history. Each button should have appropriate state management (disabled when relevant) and provide visual feedback when clicked. Deduct 3 points per missing or non-functional button.

The state transitions should be logical and bug-free (e.g., can't pause if not started). Deduct 3 points for each state management flaw, and 5 points if the selection history is not maintained.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to name selection (e.g., unneeded analytics) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down selection).
