      "description": "Review whether the code implements the essential features for report collection: form submission, data validation, and storage mechanism. Check if the system allows users to submit reports with necessary fields (name, date, content, etc.). Score 0 if collection functionality is missing, 5 if basic submission works but lacks validation, 10 if complete with proper validation and error handling.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can effectively aggregate individual reports into a consolidated document. Check if it sorts by department/date, removes duplicates, and maintains proper formatting. Deduct 5 points if consolidation is manual rather than automated, 3 points if formatting is inconsistent. Full score requires intelligent merging with categorization capabilities.",

Deduct 5 points if data is only stored in memory without persistence, 3 points if there's no backup mechanism. Give 10 points for complete implementation with transaction support and data integrity checks.",

Check if it provides different views/capabilities based on user roles. Score 0 if authentication is missing, 5 if basic login exists but lacks proper role-based permissions, 10 if complete with secure session management and fine-grained access control.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to report collection (e.g., a built-in calendar unrelated to deadlines) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
