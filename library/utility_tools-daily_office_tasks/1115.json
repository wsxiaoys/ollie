  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Please act as a web design expert and help me design a button for uploading Excel files. After uploading a file, provide a selection box that identifies field names from the user's Excel file, as these will be the basis for splitting the file in the next step.\n\nThen, when the user clicks the \"Split into separate workbooks\" button, it should split the uploaded Excel workbook according to the user-specified field. After completion, generate a download link for the folder containing the split files for easy downloading from the webpage. Please use HTML language.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements file upload validation, file format checking (.xlsx, .xls, .csv), file size limits, and proper error handling for corrupted files. Check if the upload progress indicator and drag-and-drop functionality are included. Score 0 if basic upload is not working, 5 if only basic upload works without validation, and 10 if comprehensive upload with all validations and user feedback is implemented.",

Check if it handles merged cells, empty headers, duplicate field names, and provides preview of field data. The selection UI should support search, filtering, and clear visual indication of selected fields. Deduct 5 points if field parsing fails with complex Excel structures, 3 points if no data preview is provided. Full score is 10 points.",

Verify that empty groups are handled gracefully and that the splitting process provides progress feedback.

Check if batch download is supported and download progress is shown. Deduct 5 points if file naming is inconsistent or unclear, 3 points if no cleanup mechanism exists for server storage.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Excel processing (e.g., built-in image editors) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., complex animations during file processing).
