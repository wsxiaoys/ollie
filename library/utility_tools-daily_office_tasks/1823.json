      "description": "Review whether the code implements the core functionality of adding text overlays to images. Check if users can upload/select images, add text overlays with customization options, and save/export the final result. Score 0 if core functionality is missing, 5 if basic overlay is implemented but lacks customization, and 10 if all features are fully included with a Xiaohongshu-style aesthetic.",

Should include font selection (minimum 5 popular fonts), text color picker with opacity control, font size adjustment, text alignment, rotation, and shadow/highlight effects commonly seen in Xiaohongshu posts.

Check for proper file naming options and if image dimensions match Xiaohongshu's recommended specifications.

Code should provide friendly error messages and recovery mechanisms. Check for proper event handling and memory management when processing large images. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for average robustness, 0 points if exceptions crash the application.",

Function modules unrelated to image text overlay (e.g., a built-in music player) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the interface). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global namespace pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code is difficult to maintain due to poor structure; deduct 5 points if the tool performs poorly on standard hardware.
