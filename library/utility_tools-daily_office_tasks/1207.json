      "description": "Verify if the code implements the essential elements of a JD.com login interface: logo placement at the top, input fields for username/phone and password, login button, and additional options (register, forgot password). Score 0 if missing core elements, 5 if basic elements exist but with incorrect styling, 10 if fully implemented with proper JD.com branding and layout.",

Evaluate if the code handles navigation events properly and maintains state between screens. Score 0 if navigation is not implemented, 5 if basic navigation exists but with limited functionality, 10 if complete navigation with proper transitions is implemented.",

Verify proper project structure with pages, components, and resources organized according to recommended practices. Deduct 5 points if framework features are underutilized, and 7 points if the wrong framework is used entirely. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to login or navigation (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not properly configured.
