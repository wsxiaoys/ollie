      "description": "Review whether the code implements complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for to-do items through HTML/JavaScript, including task categorization, priority settings, due date management, and completion status tracking. Score 0 if basic add/delete functions are missing, 5 if only simple task management is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive task management with filtering, sorting, and search capabilities are fully included.",

Evaluate if there's real-time synchronization across devices and offline capability. Deduct 5 points if data loss occurs on page refresh, and 3 points if no offline storage is handled.

Check if there are personalized themes, custom notification sounds, or partner interaction features. Deduct 5 points if generic templates are used without personalization.

Evaluate if there are different notification strategies for different task priorities. Deduct 5 points if no notification system exists, and 3 points if notifications don't work across different browsers. Give 10 points if fully implemented with cross-platform compatibility.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to to-do management (e.g., built-in games or unrelated widgets) 3. Overly complex animations that affect usability. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core to-do functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or no design patterns are used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no error handling or logging mechanisms exist.
