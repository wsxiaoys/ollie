  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for display. You are a web design expert, specializing in HTML code.\n\nI currently have many Excel workbooks that need to be merged into a single worksheet.\n\nI need you to create a web tool that can merge multiple workbook files. This tool should implement the following features:\n1. Provide an upload button that allows users to select multiple Excel workbooks they want to upload.\n2. Provide a merge button that, when clicked, will combine all the user-uploaded workbooks into a single worksheet.\n3. Provide a download link to let users download the merged worksheet.",

      "title": "Is the file upload mechanism properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the HTML/JavaScript code correctly implements a file upload component that allows multiple Excel file selection. Check if it includes proper file type validation (accepts .xlsx, .xls formats), provides visual feedback during the selection process, and handles large files appropriately. Score 0 if file upload is not implemented, 5 if basic uploading works but lacks validation, and 10 if fully implemented with comprehensive error handling.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the code uses appropriate libraries (like SheetJS/xlsx) to parse Excel workbooks, handles different Excel formats correctly, and properly extracts data from multiple sheets. Check if it maintains data types (numbers, dates, formulas) and handles formatting. Deduct 5 points if only one Excel format is supported, 3 points if complex Excel features (merged cells, formulas) are ignored, and 5 points if parsing errors are not handled gracefully.

      "description": "Assess whether the merging logic correctly combines data from multiple workbooks into a single worksheet, maintaining data integrity. Check if the algorithm handles duplicate header rows, preserves column order, and provides options for how to merge (append/concatenate). Deduct 5 points if the merge strategy is overly simplistic, 5 points if column mismatches between workbooks aren't handled, and 3 points if there's no conflict resolution mechanism.

Check if it correctly converts the merged data back to Excel format, creates a downloadable file with appropriate naming, and handles large datasets efficiently. Deduct 5 points if the download link appears before processing is complete, 3 points if the file naming is not user-configurable, and 5 points if download fails for large datasets.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Excel merging (e.g., unnecessary data visualization) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during processing). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no progress indication during processing of large files.
