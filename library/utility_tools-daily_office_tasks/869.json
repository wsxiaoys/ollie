Score 0 if the core functions are missing, 5 if only basic functionality exists, and 10 if all core features with proper state management are implemented.",

Check if it handles storage errors gracefully and includes data validation before storage.

Function modules unrelated to to-do management (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
