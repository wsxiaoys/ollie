Be sure to ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration purposes. Develop an intelligent screenshot annotation tool that supports adding arrows/mosaic/text annotations after capturing a region, implementing undo/redo functionality for annotation history, saving preset annotation styles, and supporting export to PNG and copying to clipboard.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements screen region selection with visual guidance (crosshair cursor, marquee selection box). Check if the captured area is accurately represented in the annotation canvas. Verify if the tool handles multiple monitors and different screen resolutions correctly. Score 0 if screen capture is not implemented, 5 if basic region capture works but has limitations, and 10 if the implementation is robust across different environments.",

Each tool should have proper mouse interaction patterns. Deduct 3 points for each missing tool. Deduct 2 points for tools with limited customization options. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that undo/redo works correctly for complex sequences of operations and after switching between annotation tools. Check if the implementation handles composite operations properly.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to screenshot annotation (e.g., a built-in image editor for other purposes) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations).
