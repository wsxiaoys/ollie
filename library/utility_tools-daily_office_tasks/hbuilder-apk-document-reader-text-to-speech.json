  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Please help me create an Android APK based on HBuilder that can achieve the following: import PDF and Word documents, then read the entire text aloud according to user instructions, or read specific paragraphs or time segments as specified by the user. The reading function should support selection between male and female voices, with multiple timbre options available. Your final output should be code that can be directly compiled and executed. Additionally, if certain features require plugins, please help me choose free options rather than paid ones.",

The solution should handle file selection from device storage, handle permissions properly, and support both file formats with proper error handling. Verify that the imported documents maintain their formatting and structure.0 points if document importing is not implemented, 5 points if only one format is supported or if implementation has significant limitations, 10 points for complete implementation supporting both formats with proper error handling and user feedback.",

Text extraction should work with both simple and complex document layouts.0 points if text extraction is missing, 4 points if only basic extraction is implemented with formatting issues, 7 points if extraction works well for most documents but has some limitations, 10 points for robust extraction that handles various document complexities.",
