      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the PDF rendering mechanism (using libraries like PDF.js) and a canvas-based signature system. Check if zooming, panning, and precise positioning of the signature on PDF pages are supported. Score 0 if core PDF display is missing, 5 if only basic rendering is available without proper user interaction, and 10 if the implementation handles multi-page documents with proper signature placement capabilities.",

      "description": "Evaluate the signature drawing functionality including stroke smoothing, pressure sensitivity (where supported), undo/redo capabilities, and saving signatures as vector formats (SVG preferred) or high-resolution bitmaps. Check if the drawing experience feels natural with anti-aliasing. Deduct 3 points if stroke smoothing is poor, 3 points if undo/redo is missing, and 4 points if the signature output quality is low. Give full 10 points only if the signature drawing feels professional-grade.",

Verify that the solution can save the signed document with proper metadata, preserving the original PDF structure and features. Deduct 5 points if signatures are not actually embedded in the PDF, 3 points if the modification doesn't maintain PDF integrity, and 2 points if metadata and audit information isn't properly updated.

Check for use of advanced TypeScript features like generics, union types, and proper null handling.

Code with strong robustness should provide friendly error messages and recovery mechanisms. Check for proper try-catch blocks and error boundaries.

Excessive third-party dependencies that could be consolidated. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
