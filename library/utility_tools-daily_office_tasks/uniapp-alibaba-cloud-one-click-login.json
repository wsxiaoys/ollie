      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements the Alibaba Cloud mobile number login SDK with proper initialization, configuration parameters, and authorization flow. Verify that AccessKeyId, AccessKeySecret, and bundle ID/package name are properly configured. Score 0 if missing critical components, 5 if basic login flow works but lacks security measures, and 10 if fully implemented with proper token handling.",

Verify cross-platform compatibility settings (iOS/Android). Deduct 5 points if platform-specific adaptation is missing, 3 points if dev/prod environments aren't separated. Full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to login flow (e.g., built-in profile editors before even logging in) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations during critical login processes). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
