      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the Minesweeper game mechanics including mine placement, cell revealing logic, adjacent mine counting, and win/loss detection. Score 0 if the core interaction logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic cell revealing is implemented without proper win/loss conditions, and 10 if all standard Minesweeper rules are fully included with proper flagging functionality.",

Check if the algorithm initializes the board only after the first click to prevent unfair game starts. Deduct 5 points if mines can appear on first click, 3 points if distribution is too clustered, and 3 points if board size options are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Minesweeper (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
