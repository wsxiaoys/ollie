      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the standard Spider Solitaire rules with card stacking sequences (King to Ace), moving complete sequences, and the ability to deal new cards when all columns have at least one card. Score 0 if core game mechanics are missing, 5 if basic card movement is implemented but with rule errors, and 10 if all standard rules are correctly implemented including different difficulty levels (1, 2, or 4 suits).",

Verify that cards can only be dealt when all columns have at least one card. Deduct 3 points if the initial deal is incorrect, 4 points if the stock pile management has errors, and 5 points if card dealing conditions aren't properly checked. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper validation of sequence completeness before removal and appropriate visual feedback. Deduct 5 points if completed sequences aren't detected properly, 3 points if removal animation is missing, and 5 points if the foundation display is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that an undo system tracks all moves and allows reversing actions.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Spider Solitaire (e.g., embedded mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).
