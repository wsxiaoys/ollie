  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement environmental interaction.\n**Task**: Add environmental interaction functionality that allows characters to interact with objects in the scene, such as pushing boxes, pulling levers, etc.\n**Tip**: You can use a simple physics engine to implement object movement and design puzzle elements for levels. Please think through and answer in detail, aiming to implement a solution that is as complete as possible, meets the requirements, has a good game interface, and high playability. Note: Use HTML to implement the above functionality, ensuring it can be directly executed in the frontend.\n\nPlease include comments in your code to help other developers understand your implementation process.",
