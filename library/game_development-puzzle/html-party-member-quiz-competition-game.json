Score 0 if core quiz logic is missing, 5 if only basic question display is implemented, and 10 if it includes a complete question bank with randomization, timing, and scoring mechanics.",

The questions should be factually accurate, educational, and aligned with Party values. Deduct 5 points if content is sparse or irrelevant, 3 points if content lacks depth or variety. Award full points only if content is comprehensive, educational and properly cited where necessary.",

Deduct 5 points if there's no progress indicator, 3 points if feedback is minimal. Full points require comprehensive statistics and educational feedback.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Party education or quiz gameplay 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down question transitions). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the HTML structure is not semantic or accessible.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for inappropriate color combinations, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",
