      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the 2048 game rules: movement in four directions, merging of same-value tiles, and random generation of new tiles (2 or 4) after each move. Score 0 if the core mechanics are not implemented, 5 if only basic movement is implemented, and 10 if all rules (including proper scoring) are fully included.",

      "description": "Check if the game board is properly rendered (typically a 4x4 grid), with clear visual representation of each tile and its value. Animations for movement and merging should be smooth. Tiles should have different colors based on their values. Deduct 3 points if the grid is not properly displayed, 3 points if tile values are not clearly visible, and 4 points if there are no animations for tile movements or merges.

Check if the game detects win/loss conditions correctly (reaching 2048 or no valid moves available). Deduct 5 points if win/loss detection is missing or incorrect, and 5 points if the score calculation is not implemented properly. The full score is 10 points.",

The code should prevent invalid moves and provide appropriate feedback.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the 2048 game (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 3 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 2 points if the code lacks comments or documentation.

Deduct 3 points for each inconsistent visual element, 5 points for poor color choices that make reading numbers difficult, and 2 points for improper responsive design. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for laggy animations, 3 points for missing visual feedback on score updates, and 2 points for any interaction that feels unnatural or abrupt. The full score is 10 points.",
