      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a system for quadratic radical operations (simplification, addition, multiplication, etc.). Check if the mathematical logic correctly handles operations like √(a²) = |a|, √(a × b) = √a × √b when a,b ≥ 0. Score 0 if the core math operations are incorrect, 5 if basic operations work but edge cases are unhandled, and 10 if all operations are mathematically sound with proper error handling.",

Check if the quadratic formula (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/2a is correctly implemented with discriminant handling.

Verify if the system handles partial credit for multi-step problems, and if score tracking persists across game sessions.

Function modules unrelated to math learning (e.g., unnecessary animations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance or distract from the learning experience.
