Make sure the code you generate can be executed and displayed properly.\n\nDo you know the game 2048? It's a grid where there are squares with numbers like 2, 4, 8, etc. Two 2s can merge to form 4, two 4s can merge to form 8. Can you implement a 2048 game using HTML5?",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the fundamental 2048 mechanics: grid initialization with random 2s or 4s, directional swipes that move and merge tiles, correct merging of identical values (2+2=4, 4+4=8, etc.), score tracking, and win/lose conditions. Score 0 if the core logic is missing, 5 if basic movement works but merging has bugs, and 10 if all game rules are correctly implemented with proper random tile generation after each move.",

Examine whether animations for tile movement and merging are included. Deduct 5 points if the grid display is static without animations, 3 points if tile colors don't follow a logical progression based on values, and 2 points if the grid layout breaks on different screen sizes.
