      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the word-matching system through HTML/JavaScript, including word pair detection, successful matching logic, and game progression tracking. Check for proper randomization of word positions, clear highlighting of selected words, and verification of valid matches. Score 0 if the core game logic is missing, 5 if basic matching is implemented but with flaws, and 10 if the mechanism works flawlessly with proper game flow.",

Check if users can upload their own word sets, if the system validates entries (preventing duplicates, empty strings, etc.), and if uploaded words are properly incorporated into the game. Deduct 5 points if validation is missing, 3 points if the storage mechanism is insecure or inefficient.",

Verify if the game properly transitions between states (start screen, gameplay, victory/defeat screens) and maintains game context correctly. Deduct 5 points if score tracking is missing or flawed, 3 points if state transitions are buggy, and 5 points if there's no proper game ending logic.",

Check for a visual timer display, score calculation based on match speed/difficulty, and potentially bonus points for consecutive matches. Verify that the scoring system is fair and the timer functions correctly (pausing when necessary, proper countdown visualization).

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to word-matching (e.g., unnecessary animations or widgets) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particles or animations).
