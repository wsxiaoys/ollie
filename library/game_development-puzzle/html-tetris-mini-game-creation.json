      "description": "Check if the code implements all essential Tetris mechanics: tetromino generation with proper shapes (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z), rotation logic (including wall kicks), collision detection, line clearing, and scoring. Score 0 if core mechanics are missing, 5 if only basic functionality works, and 10 if all standard Tetris mechanics are properly implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the game uses requestAnimationFrame or setInterval for the game loop with appropriate timing. Check if tetrominoes fall at a consistent speed with gradual difficulty increase. Verify that horizontal movement, rotation, and hard/soft drop commands work correctly with proper collision detection. Deduct 3 points if movement feels sluggish, 5 points if timing is inconsistent, and 5 points if difficulty progression is missing.",

      "description": "Check if the code properly handles keyboard input (arrow keys, space bar, etc.) with both keydown and keyup events. Verify if mobile touch controls are implemented. Evaluate if there's input buffering for quick rotations and movements. Deduct 3 points for missing mobile support, 5 points for poor input responsiveness, and 5 points if key mapping customization is not available.",

Check if pause/resume functionality works properly and if there's a high score system (preferably with localStorage). Deduct 3 points if next piece preview is missing, 3 points without score/level indicators, and 5 points without proper game start/end states.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid inputs, browser refresh, resizing) and provide friendly error handling. Check if the game state is properly managed to prevent memory leaks. Code with strong robustness should handle these edge cases effectively, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Special effects for Tetris clears 4. Power-ups or special modes). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to Tetris (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that cause lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for proper variable/function naming, comments, and consistent coding style. Deduct 5 points if global state is overused; deduct 3 points if the code is not properly structured; deduct 5 points if the code is difficult to understand or maintain. The full score is 10 points.",
