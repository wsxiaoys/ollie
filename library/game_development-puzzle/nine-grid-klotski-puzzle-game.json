      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements the 3x3 grid system with 8 number tiles and one empty space. Check if the basic sliding mechanics work (tiles adjacent to the empty space can move into it). Score 0 if the core grid system is missing, 5 if basic movement is implemented but with bugs, and 10 if the complete puzzle mechanics function properly including movement validation.",

Check for implementation of parity check or other methods that guarantee solvability.

Verify that the game provides appropriate feedback when the player wins. Deduct 5 points if win detection is faulty, and 3 points if the state management has inconsistencies.

Function modules unrelated to the puzzle (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).
