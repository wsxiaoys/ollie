      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements the core fruit merging logic correctly: collision detection between fruits of the same type, combining into the next level fruit upon contact, and appropriate physics for the merged fruit. Deduct 5 points if fruits don't merge correctly, 3 points if physics is unrealistic, and 5 points if the merge animation is missing or abrupt. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if dropping positioning is inaccurate, 3 points if there's no drop preview/indicator, and 5 points if the next fruit display is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if fruits properly stack on top of each other and if boundary collisions are detected accurately. Deduct 5 points if fruits clip through each other, 5 points if boundary detection fails, and 3 points if stacking physics is unrealistic. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down gameplay). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
