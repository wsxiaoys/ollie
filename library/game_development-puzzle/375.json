      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the fundamental Sudoku rules (no duplicate numbers in rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes). Check if puzzle generation algorithms produce valid, unique-solution puzzles with appropriate difficulty levels. Score 0 if core validation logic is missing, 5 if only basic validation is implemented, and 10 if puzzle generation and complete validation are properly implemented.",

Examine whether difficulty is calculated using recognized metrics (e.g., minimum required techniques, number of givens).

Function modules unrelated to Sudoku (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).
