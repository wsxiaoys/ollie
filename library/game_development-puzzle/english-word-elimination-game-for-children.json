Please write a code for an English word elimination game. I need to allow children to learn English words easily and happily through this game, and to discover patterns and fun in words during the gameplay.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements a complete word elimination system including word selection, scoring, user input validation, and checking for correct word patterns. Score 0 if the core game logic is missing, 5 if only basic word matching is implemented, and 10 if it includes advanced features like difficulty levels and word pattern recognition.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game effectively teaches English vocabulary through meaningful interactions. Check for age-appropriate word selection, pronunciation features, visual word-meaning associations, and progressive learning paths. Deduct 5 points if words are random without educational purpose, 3 points if difficulty progression is missing. Full score requires both engagement and pedagogical value.",

      "description": "Check if the game helps children recognize patterns in English words (like prefixes, suffixes, word families, etc.). Assess whether the game explicitly highlights these patterns or guides students to discover them. Deduct 5 points if pattern recognition is absent, and 3 points if patterns exist but aren't emphasized in gameplay. Full score requires interactive pattern discovery mechanisms.",

Score 10 points for a fully engaging experience with visual/audio rewards and positive feedback mechanisms, 5 points for basic engagement elements, and 0 points if the game lacks child-appropriate motivation systems.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to word learning (e.g., unrelated mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow loading). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there are no comments or documentation.
