Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate, professional responses. Ensure that the code you generate is executable.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a collaborative puzzle-solving game.\n\n**Task**: Design a collaborative puzzle-solving mode where players need to cooperate with AI or another player to solve puzzles.\n\n**Tip**: You can set up puzzles that require multiple people to complete, such as pressing two switches simultaneously, passing props to each other, etc.\n\nPlease include comments in your code to help other developers understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the puzzle game mechanics through HTML/JavaScript, including puzzle creation, manipulation, and completion detection logic. Evaluate the structure of the puzzle system and whether it allows for multiple players to interact with puzzle elements simultaneously. Score 0 if core puzzle mechanics are missing, 5 points if basic puzzle interaction is implemented but lacks collaborative features, and 10 points if a comprehensive puzzle system supporting collaborative actions is fully implemented.",

      "description": "Check if the game includes mechanisms that genuinely require collaboration (e.g., simultaneous button presses, complementary abilities, or shared resource management). Evaluate the synchronization of player actions and their effect on the puzzle state. Award 10 points for well-designed collaborative mechanics with clear dependency between players; 5 points if collaboration exists but feels superficial; 0 points if players can effectively solve puzzles independently without collaboration.",

The AI should demonstrate intelligent behavior, respond to the player's actions, and provide meaningful assistance in solving puzzles. Examine decision-making algorithms, pathfinding capabilities, and ability to work cooperatively. Award 10 points for sophisticated AI that feels like a real partner; 5 points for functional but basic AI; 0 points if AI is missing or completely ineffective at puzzle solving.",

Check for client-server communication or peer-to-peer mechanisms that maintain consistent game state across clients. Examine handling of latency, conflict resolution, and state reconciliation. Deduct 5 points if the synchronization mechanism lacks error handling or causes desynchronization issues. Deduct 3 points if there's no handling for network latency. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to puzzle solving (e.g., unnecessary game features that distract from the core experience) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).
