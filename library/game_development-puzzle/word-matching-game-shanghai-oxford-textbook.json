      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements word-definition matching logic through HTML/JavaScript, including vocabulary loading from Shanghai Education Oxford Textbook series, randomized word selection, drag-and-drop or click-to-match interactions, and scoring system. Score 0 if the core matching logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic word display is implemented, and 10 if complete matching mechanics with feedback are included.",

      "description": "Check whether the vocabulary data structure includes proper categorization by grade levels, units, and difficulty levels from Shanghai Education Oxford series. Evaluate if the system supports dynamic vocabulary loading, progress tracking, and adaptive difficulty adjustment. Deduct 5 points if vocabulary is hardcoded without structure, and 3 points if no difficulty progression is implemented. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for progress saving and performance analytics. Deduct 5 points if only one game mode exists, and 3 points if no learning assistance features are provided. Full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if local storage or backend integration preserves user data across sessions. Deduct 5 points if no progress persistence exists, and 3 points if achievement system is missing.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to vocabulary learning (e.g., built-in calculator or weather widget) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle animations during matching).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if vocabulary loading is inefficient or memory-intensive.
