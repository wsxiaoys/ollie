      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the player movement, box pushing mechanics, collision detection with walls and boxes, and level completion validation. Score 0 if the core interaction logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic movement is implemented without proper collision handling, and 10 if all Sokoban game rules are completely functional.",

      "description": "Check whether the game includes a level design system with multiple puzzles of varying difficulty. Evaluate if the level data structure is well-designed, allows for easy addition of new levels, and supports level progression. Deduct 5 points if only one level is implemented, 3 points if levels cannot be reset or restarted, and 2 points if there's no level completion indication. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points if keyboard controls are not implemented properly, 3 points if touch/click controls are absent for mobile compatibility, and 4 points if there's noticeable input lag or unresponsiveness.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the Sokoban gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).
