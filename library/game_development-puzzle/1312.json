  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and expert responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Please help me design a WeChat mini-game - Mahjong Tile Match. The development tool used is the WeChat Developer Tool.\n\nFor the game entrance, when users open the mini-game, they will first see a loading screen with a progress bar that updates according to resource loading progress, featuring a game background image, and a \"Start Game\" button on the page. After clicking the Start Game button, users enter the main game screen which has a large background image. Only write the relevant code and directory structure for what's described above.",

      "description": "Check whether the code properly implements a loading screen that accurately reflects resource loading progress. It should show a progress bar that updates dynamically, display a background image, and include a 'Start Game' button. The progress bar should not simply be animated but should reflect actual asset loading status. Score 0 if missing, 5 if only visually implemented without actual loading tracking, and 10 if fully functional with proper resource loading tracking.",

Check if there's proper event handling for the button click that transitions to the main game screen. Verify state management between screens.
