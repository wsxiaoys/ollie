      "description": "Check if the code implements the essential memory game mechanics: landmark cards display, card flipping animation, match detection, and game completion logic. Score 0 if core mechanics are missing, 5 if basic functionality works but with limitations, and 10 if the memory matching system is complete with proper state management.",

Deduct 3 points if generic images are used, 5 points if landmark information is missing, and 2 points if visual representation is inconsistent. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if there's only one static difficulty, 5 if basic difficulty options exist, and 10 if the game includes a comprehensive progression system that adapts to player skill.",

Deduct 3 points if score display is missing, 4 points if there's no feedback for correct/incorrect matches, and 3 points if end-game statistics are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the memory game (e.g., unnecessary mini-games within) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down card flipping). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if there's no separation of concerns; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there are no performance considerations for image loading and animations.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",
