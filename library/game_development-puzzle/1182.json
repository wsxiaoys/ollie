      "title": "Is the core Sokoban game mechanics fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the core Sokoban mechanics: player movement in four directions, box pushing rules (can push one box at a time, cannot push multiple boxes, cannot push through walls), win condition detection (all boxes on target spots). Score 0 if game mechanics are absent, 5 if basic movement works but with rule errors, and 10 if all standard Sokoban rules are correctly implemented.",

      "description": "Examine whether the game includes multiple well-designed levels with increasing difficulty, a level selection mechanism, and progression tracking. Check if levels are stored in a maintainable format (JSON/array structures) that allows easy modification. Deduct 5 points if only one level exists, 3 points if difficulty progression is illogical, and 2 points if there's no way to select levels. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the game responds correctly to keyboard inputs (arrow keys/WASD), includes touch/click controls for mobile devices, and provides visual feedback on input. Controls should feel responsive (â‰¤100ms delay) and intuitive. Deduct 5 points if only keyboard OR touch controls exist (not both), and 5 points if there are noticeable input delays.

Deduct 5 points if undo functionality is missing, 3 points if game progress is not persisted between sessions, and 2 points if restart requires page refresh. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Level editor functionality 4. Custom animations for successful level completion). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to Sokoban gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if variable and function names are not descriptive.

Deduct 3 points for each inconsistent game element, 5 points for poor contrast making gameplay difficult, and 5 points for layouts that break on mobile or smaller screens.

Deduct 5 points for jerky or missing movement animations, 3 points for lack of feedback when pushing boxes or hitting walls, and 5 points if level completion is not clearly communicated to the player.
