      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements the essential match-three mechanics: grid initialization, piece swapping, matching detection (horizontal, vertical, and potentially diagonal matches of 3+ same pieces), clearing matched pieces, and filling empty spaces with new pieces. Score 0 if core gameplay is missing, 5 if basic matching works but has flaws, 10 if all mechanics work seamlessly.",

Code with strong robustness should prevent game-breaking scenarios and recover gracefully from unexpected states, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no error handling exists, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to match-three gameplay 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down the game).
