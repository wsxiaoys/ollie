  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you produce is executable. Design a match-3 game with an 8x8 grid that randomly generates different colored blocks. Users can swap adjacent blocks to form matches of three or more of the same color. After elimination, blocks from above will fall to fill the gaps. Display the score and remaining moves.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately creates an 8x8 grid structure, properly initializes it with random colored blocks, and ensures visual representation of different colors. Each block should have a distinct visual identity (either through CSS colors, images, or SVG). Score 0 if the grid implementation is incorrect/missing, 5 if basic implementation exists but lacks proper randomization, and 10 if fully implemented with visually distinct blocks and proper randomization algorithm that prevents initial matches.",

The code should include: 1) User interaction to select blocks (click/touch/drag), 2) Validation that blocks are adjacent, 3) Visual feedback during swapping, and 4) Rejection of invalid swaps with appropriate feedback.

The algorithm should handle complex matches (T-shapes, L-shapes) and cascading matches. Deduct 5 points if only basic straight-line matches are detected, 3 points if complex matches are missed, and 3 points if the elimination animation is abrupt or missing.

Function modules unrelated to match-3 gameplay (e.g., an unnecessary settings panel with irrelevant options), 3.
