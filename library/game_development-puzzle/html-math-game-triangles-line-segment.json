  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Create an HTML code game for teaching mathematics with triangles. First, there will be a line segment, and when the teacher clicks the mouse anywhere, a triangle will be generated using that point and the line segment.",

      "description": "Check if the code properly creates a triangle when a user clicks, using the clicked point and the existing line segment as vertices. Ensure the triangle is mathematically accurate with correct coordinates. Score 0 if triangles aren't created, 5 if they're created but with positioning issues, and 10 if triangles are perfectly generated with accurate geometric properties.",

Deduct 5 points if line segments are fixed with no way to adjust them, and 3 points if adjustments are limited. The full score is 10 points.",

Look for interactive elements that demonstrate how changing the triangle affects its properties.

Code with strong robustness should prevent invalid triangles and provide appropriate feedback. Give 10 points if all common edge cases are handled, 5 points if some are addressed, and 0 points if the code breaks easily.",

Function modules unrelated to triangle mathematics (e.g., unnecessary graphics) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that distract from learning).
