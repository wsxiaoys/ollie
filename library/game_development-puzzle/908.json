I would like to create a computer version of the Sokoban puzzle game with 10 levels, ranging from easy to difficult. The main character should be a pixel art version of Nezha. Please generate the code for me.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the core Sokoban mechanics including character movement, box pushing rules, collision detection with walls, and goal completion logic. Score 0 if the core mechanics are missing, 5 if basic movement and pushing are implemented but with flaws, and 10 if the complete Sokoban ruleset is properly implemented with accurate collision detection.",

Deduct 2 points if fewer than 10 levels are provided, 5 points if difficulty progression is inconsistent or poorly balanced, and 3 points if any level is unsolvable.

The character should be recognizable as Nezha with distinct features (like the Fire-Tipped Spear, Universe Ring, or Wind Fire Wheels), have proper animations for different movements (up, down, left, right), and maintain pixel art aesthetic quality. Deduct 5 points if the character doesn't resemble Nezha, 3 points if animations are missing or poor, and 2 points if the pixel art style is inconsistent.",

An undo function should be available to revert previous moves. Deduct 5 points if there's no undo functionality, 3 points if state management is flawed or allows impossible states, and 2 points if the undo function has limitations (like limited steps).

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Sokoban gameplay 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).
