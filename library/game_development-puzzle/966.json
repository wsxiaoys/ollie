      "description": "Check whether the code implements a complete matching mechanism that allows players to select and eliminate identical icons. The matching logic should include: detection of identical icons, removal animation, and score calculation. Score 0 if the core matching logic is missing, 5 if only basic matching is implemented without proper validation, and 10 if the solution includes comprehensive matching rules with edge cases handling (such as no more possible matches detection).",

Check if the board is refilled correctly after eliminations and whether the code ensures there are always possible matches available. Deduct 5 points if the board generation doesn't guarantee solvable states, 3 points if refilling mechanism is flawed, and 2 points if icon variety is too limited. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for smooth highlighting of selected icons and intuitive error feedback for invalid moves. Deduct 5 points if there are click response delays (>100ms), 3 points if visual feedback is unclear, and 5 points if the mouse interaction isn't intuitive. Full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to matching games (e.g., an unnecessary login system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).
