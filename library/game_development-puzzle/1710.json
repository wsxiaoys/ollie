      "description": "Check if the algorithm can accurately determine whether two tiles can be connected with at most two turns. The implementation should include proper validation of matching pairs, path-finding logic, and boundary checks. Score 0 if the core algorithm is missing, 5 if basic matching works but has edge case issues, 10 if the algorithm is complete and handles all scenarios correctly.",

Check if it considers all possible paths and selects the optimal one with minimum turns. Score 0 if path recommendation is missing, 5 if basic path finding exists but isn't always optimal, 10 if the recommendation system consistently finds the best path.",

Check if the code ensures that all tiles have possible matches and includes a proper shuffling mechanism when no matches are available. Score 0 if board generation is missing or broken, 5 if basic board generation exists but may create unsolvable states, 10 if the system guarantees solvable boards and handles reshuffling appropriately.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Lianliankan (e.g., unrelated mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations slowing down gameplay). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or Flutter best practices aren't followed; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no separation between UI and game logic.
