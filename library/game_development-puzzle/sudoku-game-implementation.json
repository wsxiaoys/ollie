      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the Sudoku board generation algorithm with unique solutions, validation of user inputs against Sudoku rules (no repeats in rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids), and puzzle difficulty levels. Score 0 if the core game logic is missing, 5 if only basic validation is implemented, and 10 if complete with puzzle generation, validation, and difficulty selection.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the code includes a robust algorithm for generating valid Sudoku puzzles with unique solutions. Check for backtracking or other efficient techniques, proper removal of digits to create puzzles of varying difficulties, and verification that puzzles remain solvable. Deduct 5 points if puzzles have multiple solutions, 3 points if generation is inefficient (>500ms), and 5 points if difficulty levels aren't properly calibrated. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 2 points for each missing feature. Award full 10 points only if all these interaction elements are present and functioning correctly.",

Examine if the solver uses efficient algorithms (e.g., constraint propagation, backtracking). Deduct 5 points if hints are random rather than strategic, 3 points if solving is brute-force only, and 2 points if visualization of the solving process is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Sudoku (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during number entry). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
