      "title": "Is the core match-3 game logic fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the match-3 mechanic including grid initialization, piece swapping, match detection, cascade effects, and board refilling. Score 0 if the core interaction logic is missing, 5 if only basic matching is implemented without cascades, and 10 if the complete match-3 mechanic with cascades and special combinations is implemented.",

      "description": "Check if the code includes proper game state management (e.g., start, pause, resume, game over conditions), score tracking, level progression, and persistent storage of game progress. Deduct 3 points if there's no pause functionality, 3 points if score tracking is missing, and 4 points if there's no way to save/load game state. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game includes special pieces or power-ups that are created when matching more than 3 pieces, or in special patterns (like L or T shapes). Check for different power-up effects (e.g., row/column clearing, bomb explosions, color matching). Award 3 points for each well-implemented special piece type (up to 10 points maximum).",

      "description": "Review whether the code supports different level types, varied objectives (like reaching a score target, clearing specific tiles, collecting certain pieces), increasing difficulty progression, and time or move limits. Deduct 3 points if only one level type exists, 3 points if difficulty scaling is absent, and 4 points if there are no varied objectives. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid swaps, edge cases in matching algorithms, animation interruptions) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Unique theme or narrative elements 4. Meta-progression systems). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to match-3 gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that cause lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no separation between rendering and game logic.

Deduct 3 points for cluttered UI elements, 5 points for clashing colors or poor readability, and 5 points for lack of visual feedback during gameplay. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for jerky animations, 3 points for lack of feedback on matches, 5 points for poor touch/click response, and 4 points if cascades are visually confusing. The full score is 10 points.",
