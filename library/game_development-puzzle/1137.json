      "title": "Is the core vocabulary memorization mechanism properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code implements a proper spaced repetition system or other memory-enhancing algorithm. Check if words are shown at appropriate intervals based on user performance, and if there's a scoring mechanism that tracks learning progress. Score 0 if no memorization system exists, 5 if basic flashcards are implemented, and 10 if an advanced algorithm (like Leitner or SuperMemo) is properly coded.",

      "description": "Evaluate the data structure used for vocabulary storage. It should include at minimum: word, definition, example usage, and memorization metadata (like success rate or next review date). Check if the data persistence is implemented (LocalStorage, IndexedDB, etc.) and if there's import/export functionality for vocabulary lists. Deduct 5 points for missing persistence, and 3 points for limited word metadata. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the game offers different learning modes (e.g., flashcards, multiple choice, spelling test, matching) and adjustable difficulty levels. Deduct 3 points for each missing core learning mode, and 5 points if difficulty adjustment is absent. The system should adapt to user performance. Give 10 points only if at least three different learning modes are fully implemented with difficulty adaptation.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code includes comprehensive tracking of user learning progress, including statistics on retention rate, commonly missed words, learning streaks, and visual progress charts. Deduct 5 points if there's no visualization of progress, 3 points if historical performance cannot be reviewed, and 2 points if no session-based feedback is provided. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Fancy effects that affect performance and distract from the learning process. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core memorization functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there are no comments or documentation for complex functions.
