      "description": "Check if the code properly implements the fundamental match-3 mechanics including: grid generation, piece swapping logic, match detection (horizontal/vertical/L-shapes/T-shapes), cascade effects after matches, and board refilling. Score 0 if core matching isn't implemented, 5 if only basic 3-in-a-row detection works, and 10 if all professional match variations are supported with proper animations.",

Check if the interactions between special candies are correctly handled (e.g., striped+wrapped combination). Deduct 3 points if only basic special candies exist, 5 points if combinations aren't implemented, and 7 points if animations for special effects are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if scoring calculations account for combo multipliers and special candy creations. Deduct 5 points if objectives are missing, 3 points if scoring lacks depth, and 5 points if level progression isn't persistent. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for UI elements including score display, move counter, level selector, restart button, and game over screen.

Check if the game prevents illegal moves and handles edge cases in the match detection algorithm. Deduct 3 points for each unhandled edge case, and 5 points if the game breaks under normal usage scenarios. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to match-3 gameplay (e.g., unintegrated mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems causing lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for proper use of design patterns, consistent naming conventions, and code reusability. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if the code lacks comments and documentation.

Deduct 3 points for visually confusing game pieces, 5 points for unclear grid boundaries, and 5 points for poorly contrasting UI elements that affect readability. The full score is 10 points.",
