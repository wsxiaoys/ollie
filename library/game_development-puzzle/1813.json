Score 0 if the core matching logic is missing, 5 if only basic matching works, and 10 if advanced mechanics like special tile creation after 4+ matches and cascading matches are implemented.",

Deduct 5 points if the board generation doesn't prevent initial matches, and 5 points if the algorithm doesn't ensure solvable states after matches. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if proper localization techniques (like language resource files or objects) are used rather than hardcoded strings.

Code with strong robustness should prevent board deadlocks and handle window resizing.
