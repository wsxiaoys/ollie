  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure to provide executable code when possible. I want to create a word connection game where I upload words and then play the game based on those words. What information do I need to provide you with?",

      "title": "Is the word upload and management system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code includes a complete word upload interface (file upload/manual input), word validation (duplicate checking, format verification), and word library management functionality. Check if it supports multiple file formats (txt/csv/json) and includes word preprocessing (trimming, case normalization). Score 0 if basic upload is missing, 5 if only simple upload is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive word management with validation is included.",

      "title": "Is the word connection game logic correctly implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the core game mechanics are properly implemented: word chain validation (last letter of previous word matches first letter of next word), used word tracking, valid word verification against the uploaded dictionary, and game state management (current player, remaining words, score calculation). Deduct 5 points if connection rules are incomplete, 3 points if word validation is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the game interface includes essential elements: current word display, input field with auto-suggestions, word history panel, remaining word count, timer/scoring system, and clear game status indicators. The interface should provide real-time feedback for valid/invalid connections. Deduct 5 points if key interface elements are missing, 3 points if user feedback is inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

Give 10 points if multiple advanced features are implemented, 5 points for basic enhancements, 0 points if only core functionality exists.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid file uploads, empty word lists, invalid user input, network interruptions, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Social sharing of game results 4. Voice input support 5. Themed word categories with visual elements). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to word games (e.g., built-in social media integration) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during word input). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
