Fifth Grade Science Textbook Knowledge Outline - Second Semester\n\n## Unit 1: Heart and Brain\n### Lesson 1: Our Brain\n1. The brain is the \"command center\" of the human body, directing human actions, generating thoughts and emotions, and carrying out cognition and decision-making. The brain controls human behavior and emotions.\n2. The brain is divided into three parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. The cerebrum is divided into left and right hemispheres. Different areas have different functions.\n3. Our brain has sensory centers, auditory centers, motor centers, and visual centers.\n4. We can think, make judgments, and experience emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, and joy. This is the brain at work.\n\n### Lesson 2: The Nervous System\n1. The nervous system includes the brain, peripheral nerves, and spinal cord.\n2. Nerves are the body's \"telephone lines,\" capable of promptly reporting information obtained from various parts of the body to the brain, and transmitting commands from the brain to different parts of the body.\n3. After a starting gun fires, an athlete's ears receive the sound stimulus, the auditory nerve transmits the signal to the brain, the brain identifies it as the starting signal, and sends commands through nerves to the muscles, causing the athlete to begin running.\n4. If a finger is suddenly pricked by a sharp object, we withdraw our hand first, then feel the pain.\n\n### Lesson 3: Protecting the Brain\n1. The brain is an important organ of the human body.\n2. How does the human body protect the brain?\n   Answer: ① The skull, similar to a walnut shell, protects the brain. ② There are membranes between the skull and brain tissue that protect and support brain tissue. ③ Yawning is a brief self-protective measure that increases the brain's oxygen content.\n3. How can we protect our brain?\n   Answer: ① Adequate sleep; ② Alternating between different subjects when studying; ③ Appropriate physical exercise; ④ Not smoking or drinking excessively; ⑤ Wearing helmets when cycling.\n\n### Lesson 4: Heart and Blood Vessels\n1. People of different ages have different heart rates. Under normal circumstances, children and adolescents have 60 to 100 heartbeats per minute.\n2. Heart rate refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute. Pulse rate refers to the number of times arteries pulsate per minute. Under normal circumstances, a person's pulse rate matches their heart rate.\n3. The heart is located on the left side of the chest cavity, shaped like an inverted pear, larger at the top and smaller at the bottom, about the size of one's fist. The heart has four chambers: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle.\n4. Blood vessels are categorized as arteries, veins, and capillaries.\n5. With each contraction and relaxation of the heart, we feel one heartbeat. Generally, the heart pumps about 70ml of blood with each beat.\n6. How do we protect our heart and blood vessels?\n   Answer: ① Daily outdoor exercise; ② Maintaining a calm, optimistic attitude; ③ Balanced diet and moderate eating habits.\n\n### Lesson 5: Our Health Records\n1. Establishing health records helps us understand our physical health condition and prevent diseases in a timely manner.\n2. The WHO has proposed that a healthy person exhibits:\n   (1) Abundant energy, handling daily life and work with composure.\n   (2) Positive attitude, optimism, willingness to take responsibility, and not being picky.\n   (3) Good at resting with quality sleep.\n   (4) Strong adaptability to various environmental changes.\n   (5) Certain resistance to common colds and infectious diseases.\n   (6) Appropriate weight and balanced physique.\n   (7) Bright eyes, quick reactions, and no eyelid inflammation.\n   (8) Clean, undamaged teeth with gums that don't bleed.\n   (9) Lustrous hair without dandruff.\n   (10) Glowing skin with elasticity, walking with ease and vitality.\n\nBased on the above text, please generate an offline game code containing 50 checkpoint questions that can help fifth-grade students better master the knowledge points through gameplay.",

      "description": "Examine whether the game accurately covers the 5 key lessons from the Unit 1 'Heart and Brain' curriculum. The game should balance content from all sections (brain, nervous system, brain protection, heart and blood vessels, health records). Score 0 if major curriculum areas are missing, 5 if coverage is uneven, and 10 if all curriculum areas are thoroughly represented with accurate scientific information.",

Deduct 5 points if questions are too advanced/simple for the age group, 3 points if question types are monotonous, and 3 points if questions don't align with learning objectives.

Check if the game includes scaffolded difficulty, immediate feedback on answers, and learning reinforcement techniques. Deduct 5 points if gameplay interferes with learning objectives, 3 points if there's no adaptive difficulty, and 5 points if feedback on wrong answers lacks educational explanation.

Examine code handling for saving/loading game state. Deduct 5 points if offline mode has significant limitations, 3 points if progress saving is unreliable, and 5 points if performance issues would affect classroom use on typical school devices.
