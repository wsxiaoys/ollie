Players need to drag and rotate blocks to ensure the puppy (Cub) can reach the Star's position. This game fully utilizes creative thinking and strategic planning, providing a challenging and entertaining puzzle-solving experience.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the block manipulation system through HTML/JavaScript, including drag functionality, rotation mechanics, and path validation for the puppy's movement. Score 0 if the core interaction logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic dragging is implemented without rotation, and 10 if both dragging and rotation mechanics work seamlessly with proper collision detection.",

Check for snap-to-grid functionality, rotation pivot points, and ghost previews of potential placements. Deduct 5 points if dragging feels laggy, and 3 points if rotation lacks clear visual guidance.
