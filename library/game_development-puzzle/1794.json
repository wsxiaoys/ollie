      "title": "Is the core waste sorting mechanism fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a waste categorization system (e.g., recyclable, hazardous, organic, landfill) with proper validation logic. Check if drag-and-drop or click-to-select interactions are implemented for sorting items into appropriate bins. Score 0 if core sorting logic is missing, 5 if basic sorting is implemented but lacks validation feedback, and 10 if the system includes comprehensive item recognition with immediate feedback.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes a complete scoring mechanism that rewards correct sorting decisions and penalizes mistakes. Check if there are difficulty levels or time constraints that increase challenge as players progress. Deduct 5 points if scoring logic is inconsistent or missing, and 3 points if progression mechanics are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the game includes a varied database of waste items with accurate categorization information. Check if items have visual representations and educational descriptions about proper disposal. Deduct 5 points if fewer than 15 unique items exist, 3 points if categorizations are inaccurate, and 5 points if educational content is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Review whether the code balances entertainment value with educational content. Check if the game provides information about why items belong in certain categories and environmental impact. Deduct 5 points if the game is technically sound but lacks educational value, or vice versa. Give 10 points if both aspects are well integrated.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid clicks, incomplete drag operations, browser resize, mobile touch events) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Localized waste sorting rules based on user location 3. Customizable waste items with image upload). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to waste sorting (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow loading time). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

      "description": "Review modular design (such as separating game logic/view/controller layers), code reusability, and optimization for performance. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance optimization considerations exist (e.g., excessive DOM manipulations).

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic bin-to-item visual relationships. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for stuttering animations during item movement, and 5 points for confusing interaction patterns. The full score is 10 points.",
