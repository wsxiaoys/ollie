Multi-Player Online Multi-Colored Pixel Block Elimination Game Analysis\n\n## I. Core Gameplay and Differentiation Design\n\n1. Elimination Mechanism Optimization\n   • Visual and Operational Experience: Drawing from NetEase's similar elimination games with \"high-recognition color block design\" strategy, utilize multi-colored pixel blocks with high saturation and brightness, combined with a rounded cartoon style (similar to \"Egg Party\" style), to enhance block recognition and reduce the difficulty for players to find elimination targets.\n   • Enhanced Satisfaction: Maintain a fast pace through a \"eliminate and generate\" dynamic mechanism (immediately filling new color blocks after elimination), allowing players to continue operating before elimination animations complete, improving control and continuity.\n   • Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment: Increase block generation speed every 100 points; can adopt the \"level step count delicate control\" approach to ensure players feel the urge to \"use items to pass the level\" at critical failure points, creating payment impulses. Complete code output required.",

      "description": "Check if the code properly implements the core elimination logic with high-recognition color blocks and accurate detection of matching patterns. Verify that blocks can be eliminated when matching conditions are met (e.g., same colors adjacent, minimum cluster size). Score 0 if the elimination logic is missing, 5 if basic elimination works but has bugs, and 10 if the system handles all elimination patterns correctly with proper visual feedback.",
