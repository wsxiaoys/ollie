  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration. ======== ROLE ========\nYou are an experienced code expert. I will provide you with a software development requirement description, and you are required to generate project code based on these requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code that is fully commented in simple, easy-to-understand language, without outputting anything else.\n\n======== OUTPUT RULES ========\n1. Always generate complete, runnable project code, ensuring the project is fully executable\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete, without omitting any code\n3. Carefully review and check all code before final output, evaluating its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, regenerate it\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide mock data\n\n======== PROJECT REQUIREMENTS ========\nCreate a color elimination game with an 8x8 grid of colored blocks as the interface. When three or more blocks of the same color form a straight line, they can be eliminated. After elimination, blocks from above will fall to fill the gaps. The game ends when no more blocks can be eliminated.",
