  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Word Guessing Game\n\n### Gameplay\n1. **Choose a Letter**: Players select a letter to try to fill in the blanks of the word.\n2. **Feedback**: If the selected letter exists in the word, it will be displayed in the correct position; if it doesn't exist, the letter will be marked as incorrect and appear in the list below.\n3. **Guess the Word**: Through continuous testing and elimination of letters, players try to guess the complete word.\n\n### Game Features\n- **Logic and Memory**: The game not only tests players' logical thinking abilities but also requires good memory to recall which letters have already been tried.\n- **Learn New Vocabulary**: By constantly guessing different words, players can learn and memorize new vocabulary.\n- **Suitable for All Ages**: This game has no age restrictions; people of all ages can learn new words and test their memory through this format.\n\n### Game Tips\n- **Frequent Letters First**: First try using the most frequently occurring letters in English, such as E, A, R, etc.\n- **Start from Parts of Speech**: Based on the length of the word and known letters, predict the possible part of speech, such as verb, noun, etc.\n- **Pay Attention to Letter Combinations**: Consider common letter combinations like \"CH\", \"ST\", etc., which can help quickly narrow down the word range.\n\n### Summary\n\"Word Guessing Game\" is an educational and challenging game suitable for players who want to improve their vocabulary and logical thinking skills. This game format is simple but can effectively exercise the brain, making it suitable as a learning tool or recreational game.",

Look for proper initialization of a hidden word, tracking of guessed letters, and validation of player inputs. Score 0 if basic mechanics are missing, 5 if implementation is basic but functional, and 10 if the system properly handles all core gameplay elements with clean state management.",
