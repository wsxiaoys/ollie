      "description": "Review how effectively the code implements the fundamental time reversal system through state recording and restoration.Score 0 if no time reversal functionality exists, 5 if only basic state tracking is implemented, and 10 if the system can seamlessly record and restore complex game states including player position, object states, and interactions. Check if the implementation uses an efficient data structure for state storage that balances memory consumption with rewind fidelity.",

Score 0 if there are no actual puzzles implemented, 5 if puzzles are basic and don't fully utilize the time reversal concept, and 10 if puzzles demonstrate complex cause-and-effect relationships across time that require creative thinking to solve. Puzzle progression should increase in difficulty and introduce new mechanics gradually.",

Score 0 if state tracking is missing, 5 if only basic elements (like position) are tracked, and 10 if the system handles complex states including physics interactions, animations, and conditional triggers.

Score 0 if no visual feedback exists, 5 if basic indicators are present but unclear, and 10 if time manipulation includes intuitive UI elements, smooth visual effects (like color shifts, motion blur, or particle effects), and clear audio cues that enhance player understanding of the time mechanics.",
