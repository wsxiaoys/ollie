      "description": "Review whether the code creates an immersive forest environment through HTML/CSS/JavaScript, including appropriate background imagery, forest elements (trees, paths, magical items), and ambient effects. Score 0 if the environment is not implemented, 5 if a basic static forest is created, and 10 if the forest is visually rich with dynamic elements and responsive design.",

Scoring: 0 points if puzzles are missing/non-functional, 5 points for basic puzzles without variety, 10 points for diverse, challenging puzzles with proper solution validation and feedback systems.",

Review whether the code implements player movement/controls, inventory management if applicable, and a logical puzzle progression sequence.

Check for special effects when magic is used, appropriate visual feedback, and integration with puzzle mechanics. Deduct 5 points if magical elements are purely decorative, 3 points if interactions are limited. Give 10 points for a fully developed magical system that's central to gameplay.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the magic forest theme (e.g., unrelated mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down gameplay). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if comments are missing or insufficient.
