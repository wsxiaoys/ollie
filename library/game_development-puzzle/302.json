      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the 2048 game mechanics including tile merging, movement in all four directions, and scoring system. Check if the algorithm correctly handles the merging of same-value tiles and prevents illegal moves. Score 0 if the core logic is missing, 5 if basic movements work but with edge case bugs, and 10 if all game rules are perfectly implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game properly initializes with 2 random tiles at the start, and adds a new tile (with value 2 or 4) after each valid move. Check if the random tile generation only occurs in empty spots and follows the correct probability distribution (90% for 2, 10% for 4). Deduct 5 points if random generation is deterministic or biased, and 3 points if new tiles don't appear after valid moves. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the game provides appropriate feedback upon winning or losing. Deduct 5 points if only one condition is implemented, and 3 points if the detection is delayed or buggy.

Check for gesture recognition accuracy, handling of simultaneous inputs, and prevention of accidental moves. Deduct 5 points if only keyboard controls work, 3 points if touch controls are implemented but unreliable, and 2 points if input handling has noticeable delay. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should prevent game state corruption and handle these edge cases. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if the game breaks easily under non-standard use.",

Overengineered animations that affect performance. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
