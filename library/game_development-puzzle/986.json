Hello, could you please help create a web-based Tetris game where the blocks are cartoon fruit shapes instead of traditional shapes?",

      "title": "Is the core Tetris game mechanics fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code implements all standard Tetris mechanics including block rotation, movement, line clearing, scoring system, and increasing difficulty. Check if the game loop runs smoothly at 60fps. Score 0 if core mechanics are missing, 5 if basic movement works but some mechanics are incomplete, 10 if all standard Tetris mechanics are properly implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code replaces traditional Tetris blocks with distinct fruit shapes that maintain gameplay balance. Check if the fruits have clear visual designs with proper hitboxes that match their appearance. Examine if the rotation of fruit shapes feels natural and consistent. Score 0 if still using traditional shapes, 5 if fruits are implemented but have visual or functional issues, 10 if fruits are well-designed, visually appealing, and function correctly.",

      "description": "Check if the collision detection works correctly with the irregular fruit shapes. Verify that fruits stack properly on the game grid without visual glitches or logical errors. Test edge cases like wall kicks and floor kicks. Deduct 5 points for collision bugs, 3 points for grid alignment issues, and 2 points if rotation near walls causes problems. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Verify keyboard controls for movement (left/right/down), rotation, and hard drop. Check if mobile touch controls are implemented with swipe gestures and tap actions. Test responsiveness of controls (should be under 100ms). Evaluate if there's a pause function and game reset option. Deduct 3 points if mobile support is missing, 5 points if controls feel unresponsive, and 2 points if pause/reset functions are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid input, browser resize, focus loss, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Fruit-matching bonus mechanics 4. Dynamic backgrounds based on fruit types). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to fruit-themed Tetris (e.g., unnecessary social media features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down gameplay). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state management is messy; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance optimizations are implemented for rendering multiple fruit shapes.

Deduct 3 points for inconsistent fruit designs, 5 points for a cluttered game UI, and 5 points for poor contrast between fruits and background. The full score is 10 points.",
