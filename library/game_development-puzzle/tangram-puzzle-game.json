  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Ensure that the generated code is executable and functional.\n\n## Role ##\nYou are an experienced code expert. You are provided with a software development requirement description and asked to generate project code based on these requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code that is fully commented with simple, easy-to-understand language, without outputting anything else.\n\n## Output Rules ##\n1. Always generate complete, runnable project code, ensuring the project is fully executable\n2. Ensure that all code files you output are complete, without omitting any code\n3. Carefully review and check all code before final output, evaluating its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, it needs to be regenerated\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide simulated data\n\n## Project Requirements Description ##\nPlease develop a 'Tangram' puzzle game. The game interface is divided into two parts: an area displaying the target shape, and an area where players can manipulate the tangram pieces. The tangram consists of 7 geometric shapes (2 large triangles, 1 medium triangle, 2 small triangles, 1 square, and 1 parallelogram). Players can move each shape by dragging, rotate a shape by clicking on it, and flip a shape by double-clicking it. The goal of the game is to use these 7 shapes to create the target shape. The game should provide multiple target shapes of varying difficulty to choose from, a reset button to restore all shapes to their initial positions, and a hint feature (briefly showing the correct position of one shape). When the player successfully completes the target shape, display a congratulatory message and the time taken.",

      "description": "Check if the code correctly implements all 7 tangram pieces (2 large triangles, 1 medium triangle, 2 small triangles, 1 square, and 1 parallelogram) with appropriate visual representation. Each shape should have distinct characteristics and proper proportional sizes. Verify that the shapes can be properly rendered on the canvas/display area without visual artifacts. Score 0 if pieces are missing or incorrectly implemented, 5 if basic shapes are implemented but with proportion/rendering issues, and 10 if all shapes are perfectly implemented with proper scaling.",
