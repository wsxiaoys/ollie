I am a middle school geography teacher and want to help students master the climate types of Asia through a puzzle game. (Temperate monsoon climate-Beijing, Subtropical monsoon climate-Shanghai, Tropical monsoon climate-Mumbai, Tropical rainforest climate-Indonesia, Tropical desert climate-Saudi Arabia, Mediterranean climate-Italy, Temperate continental climate-Xinjiang, Plateau mountain climate-Tibet, Arctic climate-North Pole) Please generate online puzzle game code.",

      "title": "Is the core geography puzzle game mechanic implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements the matching mechanism between climate types and their respective geographic locations (Beijing, Shanghai, Mumbai, etc.). Check if all 9 climate types mentioned are included with accurate associations. Score 0 if the core puzzle logic is missing, 5 if basic matching exists but with inaccurate geography information, and 10 if all climate types and locations are correctly implemented with educational validity.",

      "title": "Is the interactive learning mechanism effectively designed?",
      "description": "Assess whether the game includes educational components that help students learn while playing. Check for explanatory text about each climate type, feedback mechanisms that explain why matches are correct/incorrect, and progressive difficulty levels. Deduct 3 points if climate descriptions are missing, 4 points if no educational feedback exists, and 3 points if the learning curve is inappropriate for middle school students. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Review the implementation of geographic visualization (map of Asia, climate zone indicators, location markers). Check if the map accurately represents Asian geography with proper country boundaries and if the climate zones are visually distinguishable. Score 0 if no map visualization exists, 5 if basic visualization exists but with geographic inaccuracies, and 10 if visualization is geographically accurate and educationally valuable.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of game progression tracking, scoring system, and completion metrics. Check for features like progress saving, performance metrics (time taken, accuracy rate), and level progression. Deduct 3 points if no scoring mechanism exists, 4 points if game state isn't preserved between sessions, and 3 points if performance tracking is inadequate for educational assessment.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to geography learning (e.g., unrelated mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that distract from learning).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code lacks comments or documentation for educational content.
