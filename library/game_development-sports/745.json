      "description": "Check whether the code accurately implements physics-based prediction for billiard ball trajectories, including proper angle calculation, reflection off cushions, and potential ball collision paths. Score 0 if core trajectory calculation is missing, 5 if only basic straight-line prediction is implemented, and 10 if it handles complex rebounds and ball-to-ball collisions accurately.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the aiming line updates dynamically as the user moves the cue, with proper visualization techniques (dashed/solid lines, color gradients to indicate force, etc.). The visualization should clearly distinguish between the initial trajectory and subsequent rebounds. Deduct 5 points if the line doesn't update in real-time, and 3 points if visual clarity is poor. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if only basic linear physics are used, 5 if friction is included but spin is absent, and 10 if all professional billiards physics aspects are modeled, including english/spin effects on ball trajectories.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to billiards aiming (e.g., unnecessary game modes) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects when balls collide).
