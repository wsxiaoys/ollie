Try to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a sports game: Player Control and Game Rules\n**Task**: Implement a player control system where players can control athletes to perform actions like passing, shooting, etc. in a match while following game rules.\n**Hint**: You can use keyboard or gamepad input to control the players, and design basic game rule logic.\nPlease include comments in your code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements comprehensive player controls with keyboard/gamepad input handling. Check for implementation of movement controls (up/down/left/right), action keys (pass/shoot/tackle), and modifier keys (sprint/special moves). Score 0 if basic movement controls are missing, 5 if only simple movement and basic actions are implemented, and 10 if the control system includes advanced mechanics like player stamina effects, contextual actions, and responsive inputs.",

Check for proper implementation of physics for ball movement, player collisions, and interaction between players and ball. Deduct 5 points if core rules like scoring or boundaries are missing, and 3 points if physics implementation is unrealistic.

Check if the game state management includes handling of different game phases (pre-match, active play, paused, scoring events, game over). Deduct 5 points if the game loop implementation causes performance issues or visual stuttering, 3 points if state transitions are poorly implemented.

Check for path-finding algorithms, decision-making logic based on game context, and realistic team formations/positioning. Deduct 5 points if AI athletes stand still or move randomly without purpose, 3 points if AI is too predictable or lacks variability in behavior. Full points require AI that adapts to player actions and demonstrates strategic behavior appropriate for the sport being simulated.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to sports gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down gameplay).
