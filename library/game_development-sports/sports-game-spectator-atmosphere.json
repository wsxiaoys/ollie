      "title": "Is the spectator system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code implements a dynamic spectator system with varied reactions to different game events. Score 0 if spectators are just static images, 5 if basic crowd animations exist but with limited variety, and 10 if spectators show contextually appropriate reactions to multiple game scenarios (e.g., cheering for goals, disappointed reactions for misses, wave animations during slow moments).",

      "description": "Check if the audience reactions are properly triggered by game events through an event system. The implementation should include event listeners for game scenarios, randomized reaction selection based on event type, and smooth transitions between different crowd states. Deduct 5 points if reactions are hard-coded/timed rather than event-driven, and 3 points if there's no variation in reactions to similar events. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether appropriate sound effects are implemented for crowd reactions (cheers, gasps, applause, boos, chants, etc.) with volume control and proper audio layering. Assess if sounds match the visual reactions and game context. Deduct 5 points if sound effects don't vary by event intensity, 3 points if there's no volume control based on event importance, and 5 points if there are no sounds at all.

      "description": "Analyze whether the code implements a scalable system that can adjust crowd density, reaction intensity, and home/away fan distribution. Check for parameters that control crowd bias, crowd size, enthusiasm levels, and noise levels. Deduct 5 points if the system has fixed crowd settings, 3 points if it lacks home/away fan distinction, and 3 points if crowd enthusiasm doesn't change throughout the game.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to spectator atmosphere (e.g., unnecessary game mechanics) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., too many individual spectator animations running simultaneously). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance considerations are implemented for large crowds.
