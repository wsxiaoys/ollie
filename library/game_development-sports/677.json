  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Implement an archery scoring system. Use device gyroscope to control aiming (via DeviceOrientation API), simulate drawing the bow through mouse movement speed, and display bowstring vibration effects. Arrow flight should be affected by wind forces (random vectors). After hitting the target center, show slow-motion replay. The scoring calculation needs to consider arrow compression effects (handling overlap in adjacent scoring zones).",

      "title": "Is the gyroscope aiming control system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements DeviceOrientation API integration for aiming control, including gyroscope data filtering, calibration mechanism, and smooth aiming cursor movement. Check if proper permission handling and fallback mechanisms are provided for devices without gyroscope support. Score 0 if gyroscope control is not implemented, 5 if only basic orientation detection works, and 10 if full gyroscope aiming with calibration and smooth filtering is included.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the mouse movement speed detection accurately simulates bow drawing mechanics, including draw strength calculation, release timing detection, and realistic bowstring vibration effects using canvas/WebGL animations. Check if the bowstring tension visualization responds correctly to drawing speed and provides haptic-like feedback. Deduct 5 points if vibration effects are missing, and 3 points if draw strength calculation is inaccurate. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if wind visualization (particles, indicators) is present and if the flight path realistically responds to environmental factors. Deduct 5 points if wind effects are static or unrealistic, and 3 points if trajectory physics don't account for arrow mass and velocity degradation. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if slow-motion replay is triggered on target center hits with smooth animation interpolation. Deduct 5 points if compression effects are not calculated, and 3 points if slow-motion replay is choppy or missing. Give 10 points if fully implemented with accurate scoring logic.",

Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle gyroscope unavailability, extreme mouse speeds, and rendering performance issues, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to archery (e.g., built-in social media sharing) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems during arrow flight).
