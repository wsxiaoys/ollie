  "question": "You are a coding expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. Create a racing game with a first-person driver's perspective, allowing for left and right turns, acceleration and deceleration based on the track. The track should resemble a realistic three-dimensional racing circuit.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements a first-person perspective camera system using WebGL/Three.js or Canvas 3D, including proper field of view (FOV 60-90°), camera positioning inside the cockpit, and realistic depth perception. The view should include dashboard elements and steering wheel. Score 0 if only 2D top-down view is provided, 5 if basic 3D view without cockpit details, and 10 if full immersive first-person racing experience with proper perspective projection.",

      "description": "Check whether the implementation includes proper physics simulation for acceleration, deceleration, steering dynamics, and momentum conservation. Vehicle should have inertia, drift mechanics, speed-dependent turning radius, and realistic braking distance. Keyboard/gamepad controls should be responsive with proper input mapping (WASD/Arrow keys for steering, acceleration/braking). Deduct 5 points if physics feel arcade-like without momentum, 3 points if steering lacks progressive response. Full score requires realistic vehicle dynamics.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the track features realistic 3D geometry with proper banking, elevation changes, curves of varying difficulty, and track boundaries. Track should include visual elements like barriers, grass/gravel run-off areas, start/finish line, and lap markers. Texture mapping and lighting should create depth and realism. Deduct 5 points if track is flat without elevation, 3 points if missing proper track boundaries or visual landmarks. Full score requires professional circuit-like design.",

Should handle race completion, lap records, and restart functionality. Deduct 5 points if lap detection is inaccurate, 3 points if missing essential HUD elements, 2 points if no timing system.

Code should gracefully handle WebGL context loss and provide meaningful error messages. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic exception management, and 0 points if no error handling is implemented.",

Dynamic weather/lighting conditions 3. Multiple camera angles 4. Ghost car for lap comparison 5. Particle effects for tire smoke/sparks).

Unnecessary non-racing features (e.g., built-in chat system, unrelated mini-games) 3. Performance-heavy visual effects that don't enhance racing (e.g., excessive particle systems, overly complex shaders). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core racing performance is significantly impacted by bloated features.",

Check for proper asset loading optimization, frame rate management (targeting 60fps), and memory usage patterns. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution or poor separation of concerns; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate exceeds 30% or lacks consistent coding patterns; deduct 5 points if no performance optimization considerations for 3D rendering.
