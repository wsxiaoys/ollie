      "title": "Is the physics collision system properly implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code accurately implements a physics-based collision detection system that handles different types of collisions (e.g., player-to-player, player-to-environment). Check for proper collision response including momentum conservation, force application, and rebound effects. Score 0 if collision detection is missing, 5 if only basic collisions are detected without proper physics, and 10 if the implementation includes realistic physical properties (mass, velocity, acceleration) with accurate response calculations.",

      "description": "Assess whether animations properly respond to collision events and transition smoothly between states (idle, running, collision, recovery). Check if the animation system includes proper blending, interpolation techniques, and timing synchronization with the physics engine. Deduct 5 points if animations don't match collision intensity, 3 points if transitions are jarring, and full points if animations dynamically adapt to different collision scenarios with proper transition timing.",

      "description": "Verify that the code differentiates between collision types (head-on, glancing, side impacts) and responds with different animation sequences and physical outcomes. Check whether collision angle and force affect the response. Score 0 if all collisions are handled identically, 5 if there's basic differentiation, and 10 if the system accounts for collision angle, force, player attributes, and produces varied realistic outcomes.",

Deduct 5 points if physics calculations are frame-dependent, 3 points if there's no separation between physics and rendering loops, and 5 points if there's no handling for performance degradation scenarios.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively prevent physics glitches, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no error handling exists for physics edge cases, give 0 points.",

Dynamic camera angles that focus on collision points 3. Visual/audio feedback proportional to collision intensity).

Function modules unrelated to the sports game mechanics (e.g., unrelated mini-games) 3. Excessive effects that affect performance without meaningful gameplay impact.
