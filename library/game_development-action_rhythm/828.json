Score 0 if core combat logic is missing, 5 if basic attack/defense mechanics exist but lack depth, and 10 if the system includes advanced features like critical hits, combo systems, and varied attack types with appropriate physics.",

Deduct 5 points if movement feels rigid or unnatural, 3 points if collision detection is inconsistent, and 5 points if character-environment interaction is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Look for appropriate difficulty scaling and enemy AI patterns. Deduct 5 points if enemy behavior is too predictable, 3 points if difficulty balance is poorly implemented, and 5 points if core game state variables aren't properly tracked.

Combat should feel impactful with appropriate visual/audio cues.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to combat gameplay (e.g., unnecessary complex inventory systems) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that cause frame drops).
