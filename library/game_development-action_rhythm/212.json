  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Create an animation code of two little figures fighting - one red figure and one blue figure. Don't use simple blocks to represent the figures; they should have relatively realistic human body shapes with heads, hands, and feet. Both figures should be holding knives. The code should be directly runnable on mobile phones!",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the figures have realistic human body proportions with clearly defined heads, torsos, arms, legs, and feet. The figures should not be simplistic stick figures or blocks. Check whether the body parts are properly connected and move naturally during the animation. Score 0 if only basic shapes are used, 5 if figures have basic body parts but with unrealistic proportions, and 10 if figures appear realistic with proper anatomical structure.",

      "description": "Review the implementation of weapon holding and combat movements. The knives should be visually distinct objects that remain properly positioned in the figures' hands during movement. Combat animations should include attack motions, defensive postures, and appropriate weapon trajectories. Deduct 5 points if weapons float disconnected from hands, 3 points if combat movements are too simplistic (less than 3 distinct fighting moves). Give 10 points if weapons appear naturally held with realistic combat movements.",

      "description": "Assess whether the red and blue figures are clearly distinguishable not just by color but also potentially by subtle differences in appearance or fighting style. Color contrast should be sufficient for visibility on various backgrounds. Deduct 3 points if the color difference is the only distinguishing feature, 5 points if the figures are identical apart from color. The full score is 10 points for characters with unique identities beyond color.",

Unnecessary features unrelated to the fighting animation (e.g., unrelated background animations) 3. Excessive effects that cause performance issues on mobile devices.
