Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\nPlease implement an action game - rhythm game: difficulty curve and rhythm changes\n**Task**: Implement a difficulty curve system where the rhythm speeds up or becomes more complex as the game progresses, challenging the player's reaction ability.\n**Hint**: You can increase game difficulty by gradually adding key combinations and shortening reaction time.\n[CHAT_SEP]Please optimize the game response above and add some comments in the code to help other developers understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements the fundamental rhythm game mechanics with proper timing systems (measuring in milliseconds), hit detection zones, and scoring mechanics. Check if the timing window for inputs is properly calibrated (perfect/good/miss zones). Score 0 if core mechanics are missing, 5 if basic hit detection exists but lacks precision, and 10 if the timing system is accurately implemented with proper calibration.",

      "description": "Analyze how the difficulty increases throughout gameplay. Look for systematic implementation of: 1) Gradually increasing tempo/BPM, 2) Introducing more complex patterns, 3) Shortening reaction windows, and 4) Adding key combinations as gameplay progresses. Deduct 3 points for each missing progression element. Give full marks only if difficulty changes are smoothly implemented with proper pacing rather than abrupt jumps.",

      "description": "Check whether the game elements (notes, visual cues, audio) are properly synchronized to the beat. Verify if the code implements audio analysis or fixed beat tracking to ensure game events align with music rhythm. Deduct 5 points if there's noticeable audio-visual lag, 3 points if synchronization drifts over time. The full score requires precise frame-level synchronization with compensation for browser performance variations.",

Deduct 3 points if feedback is delayed (>100ms), 3 points if visual clarity is poor during intense sequences, and 5 points if performance feedback is absent. Full score requires distinct visual feedback for different timing accuracies.",

Code with strong robustness should include frame rate compensation, audio sync recovery, and input buffering. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic stability measures, and 0 points if performance issues break gameplay.",

Function modules unrelated to rhythm gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particles during critical gameplay).
