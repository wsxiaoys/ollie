      "description": "Review whether the code implements core parkour mechanics including: character movement, jumping mechanism, obstacle generation and collision detection. Score 0 if the character cannot move, 5 if only basic left-right movement exists, and 10 if complete parkour mechanics (including jumping, dodging, and progressive difficulty) are implemented.",

      "description": "Check whether the Wong Ka Kui character is visually recognizable (either through sprites or CSS design), has appropriate animations for different actions (running, jumping, falling), and maintains the iconic elements associated with the Beyond vocalist. Deduct 5 points if the character lacks recognizable features, 3 points if animations are missing, and 2 points if proportions are significantly distorted. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the WASD key controls are responsive (â‰¤100ms delay), intuitive (W for jump, A/D for left/right movement, S for ducking/sliding), and handle edge cases like multiple key presses. Check for keyboard event listeners and proper key mapping. Deduct 5 points if controls are unresponsive or laggy, and 5 points if key combinations aren't handled properly.

Deduct 3 points for monotonous obstacles, 3 points for missing score tracking, and 4 points if the difficulty doesn't increase over time. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the parkour game (e.g., unnecessary menus or settings) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particles or animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if game functions are not encapsulated properly; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code lacks comments or documentation.
