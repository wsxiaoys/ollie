      "description": "Review whether the code implements the essential game mechanics through HTML/JavaScript, including fruit generation, gravity simulation for falling objects, player-controlled basket/character movement, and precise collision detection. Score 0 if the core interaction logic is missing, 5 if only basic movement without proper collision detection is implemented, and 10 if the complete game cycle with variable difficulty is included.",

      "description": "Check if the game includes a functional countdown timer that properly terminates the game, and a scoring system that accurately tracks successful fruit catches. Verify that the score is properly incremented when fruits are caught and that the timer decrements correctly. Deduct 5 points if the timer doesn't end the game, 3 points if score calculation has bugs, and 2 points if there's no visual feedback when points are earned. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the game features different fruit types with distinct visual appearances, falling speeds, point values, or special effects. Deduct 5 points if only a single fruit type exists, 3 points if fruits look different but behave identically, and 2 points if there's insufficient variety (less than 3 types). Give full 10 points for rich variety with meaningful gameplay differences.",

      "description": "Assess if the game's difficulty increases over time through mechanisms like faster falling fruits, more fruits appearing simultaneously, or introduction of obstacles/distractions. Check if level progression or wave system is clearly communicated to players. Deduct 5 points if difficulty remains static throughout gameplay, and 3 points if difficulty curve is too steep or unbalanced. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Combo system for catching multiple fruits in succession). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to fruit catching (e.g., unnecessary minigames) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects).
