  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration purposes.\n\nPlease implement a Crossy Road game using HTML and JavaScript.\n\n### Gameplay\n- **Movement Control**: Use keyboard or on-screen buttons to control character movement in four directions.\n- **Avoid Obstacles**: Dodge oncoming vehicles and other obstacles.\n\n### Game Features\n- **3D Graphics**: Use the three.js library to create an engaging 3D environment.\n- **Increasing Difficulty**: As the player progresses, the speed and frequency of obstacles increase.\n\n### Game Tips\n- **Predict Routes**: Observe and predict vehicle travel paths to make movement decisions in advance.\n- **Patient Waiting**: When necessary, wait for safe crossing opportunities.\n\n### Summary\n\"Crossy Road with threejs\" is a 3D road-crossing game based on three.js. Players control a small animal, moving quickly and strategically to avoid vehicles with the goal of crossing roads as much as possible. This game provides an exciting gaming experience suitable for players who enjoy testing their reaction speed and strategic planning abilities. Please include some comments in your code to help other developers understand your implementation process.",

Check if keyboard controls and optional on-screen buttons are functional.Score 0 if core movement and collision detection are not implemented, 5 if basic movement works but collision is unreliable, 10 if movement is smooth with proper collision detection and game progression logic is complete.",

This should include faster vehicles, more frequent obstacles, or decreased spacing between safe zones.
