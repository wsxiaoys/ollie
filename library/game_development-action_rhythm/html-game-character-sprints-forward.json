      "title": "Is the basic game character and movement system implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the code implements a character that moves forward continuously with proper animation frames. Verify if the character maintains consistent forward movement (sprinting) without stopping. Score 0 if there's no character movement, 5 if there's basic movement without animation, and 10 if the character has smooth sprinting animation with proper frame transitions.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the game has a scrolling background or environment elements that create the illusion of the character moving forward. Check for parallax scrolling effects (multiple layers moving at different speeds) and if the environment repeats seamlessly. Score 0 if there's no background, 5 if there's a static or basic scrolling background, and 10 if there's a well-implemented parallax scrolling effect with seamless transitions.",

      "description": "Review if the game includes user input handling (keyboard/touch controls) for actions like jumping, ducking, or changing lanes. Test the responsiveness of controls (input lag <50ms) and verify if there are visual cues for available actions. Score 0 if there are no controls, 5 if basic controls exist but feel sluggish, and 10 if controls are responsive and intuitive with appropriate feedback.",

      "description": "Check if the code implements a proper game loop using requestAnimationFrame() or similar methods, maintaining consistent frame rates (ideally 60fps) and including time-based movement calculations instead of frame-based to ensure consistent speed across different devices. Score 0 if there's no game loop, 5 if there's a basic loop without performance optimization, and 10 if there's a well-optimized game loop with frame timing.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the sprint game (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that cause lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if assets are loaded during gameplay causing stutters.

Deduct 3 points for each inconsistent visual element, 5 points for confusing UI/game element boundaries, and 5 points for poorly implemented text elements. The full score is 10 points.",
