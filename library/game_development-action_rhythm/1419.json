Check if there are health systems, damage calculation, and hit detection logic. Score 0 if the core interaction logic is not implemented, 5 if only basic movement and attacks exist, and 10 if advanced combat mechanics (combos, special moves, blocking) are fully included.",

Function modules unrelated to fighting gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down gameplay).
