Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a platform jumping game where players need to jump and climb to pass through levels while avoiding traps. Set up jumping and climbing controls, and design various platforms and traps. Please include comments in your code so that other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "title": "Is the core platform jumping mechanic fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements jumping physics with gravity simulation, variable jump height based on button press duration, and proper collision detection with platforms. Score 0 if basic jumping is missing, 5 if only basic jumping is implemented without physics refinement, and 10 if jumping feels responsive with polished physics (e.g., terminal velocity, jump buffering, coyote time).",

      "description": "Check whether the climbing mechanics include proper collision detection with climbable surfaces, smooth transitions between climbing and jumping states, and appropriate control limitations while climbing. Score 0 if climbing is not implemented, 5 if basic climbing exists but feels clunky or has collision issues, and 10 if climbing is smooth with proper animation transitions and intuitive controls.",

      "description": "Evaluate the diversity and functionality of platforms (static, moving, disappearing, bouncy) and traps (spikes, falling objects, timing-based hazards). Deduct 3 points if fewer than 3 platform types are implemented, 5 points if traps have no visual warning indicators, and 3 points if collision detection with hazards is inconsistent. Score 10 if at least 5 different interactive platform/trap types are implemented with clear visual distinction.",

Score 0 if only a single static level exists, 5 if multiple levels exist but lack progression in difficulty or design variety, and 10 if the game has thoughtful level progression with checkpoint systems and escalating challenges.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Environmental interactions like destructible objects 3. Dynamic camera effects that respond to gameplay 4. Particle effects for movement feedback).

Function modules unrelated to platform jumping gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that cause lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code lacks the requested comments explaining the implementation; deduct 5 points if there's significant code duplication instead of reusable functions.
