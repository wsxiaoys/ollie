      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the hunting gameplay with proper player controls and dinosaur tracking mechanics. Check if there's hit detection, player movement, aiming/shooting mechanics, and appropriate feedback. Score 0 if core mechanics are missing, 5 if basic movement and shooting exist but lack polish, and 10 if the hunting experience is comprehensive with diverse mechanics.",

Check for path-finding algorithms, state machines controlling behavior, and varying difficulty levels among different dinosaur types. Deduct 5 points if dinosaurs move in predictable patterns without adaptation, and 3 points if there's only one behavior pattern. The full score requires at least 3 distinct, realistic behavior patterns.",

Assess whether the player has meaningful choices in how to approach dinosaurs. Deduct 5 points if tracking is purely random, 5 points if there's only one viable hunting strategy, and 3 points if feedback on hunting success is unclear. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to dinosaur hunting (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects).
