      "title": "Is the core racing game mechanics fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the racing physics system through JavaScript, including collision detection, acceleration/deceleration, handling, and track boundaries. Score 0 if the core game loop is missing, 5 if only basic movement is implemented, and 10 if it includes realistic physics like friction, drift, and aerodynamics.",

      "description": "Check whether the code creates a compelling racing environment with a clearly defined track, obstacles, and visual indicators for player guidance. Deduct 3 points if the track is too simplistic (just straight lines), 5 points if collision boundaries are inconsistent with visuals, and 2 points if there's no track variety. Full score requires at least one complete circuit with proper checkpoints.",

Deduct 3 points for missing lap verification, 3 points for no time tracking, and 4 points if there's no way to determine race completion. The full score requires a complete race lifecycle from start to finish.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid input changes, browser performance issues, or unexpected user interactions) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to racing (e.g., mini-games that distract from the main experience) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects causing frame drops). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no performance optimization for smooth gameplay. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the overall design follows modern game UI principles: 1) Clear heads-up display (speedometer, lap counter, position) 2) Proper visual hierarchy (important info more prominent) 3) Non-intrusive UI elements that don't obstruct gameplay. Deduct 3 points for cluttered UI elements, 5 points for poor readability during gameplay, and 5 points for missing critical race information. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for noticeable input lag, 3 points for jerky animations during turns or collisions, and 5 points for inconsistent physics behavior. The full score is 10 points.",
