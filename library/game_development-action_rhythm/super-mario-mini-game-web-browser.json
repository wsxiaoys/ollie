      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements essential Mario mechanics: character movement (left/right), jumping physics with gravity, collision detection (platforms, obstacles, enemies), and power-up systems (mushrooms, fire flowers). Score 0 if core mechanics are missing, 5 if only basic movement and jumping are implemented, and 10 if all classic Mario mechanics are present.",

      "description": "Check if enemies (Goombas, Koopas, etc.) have proper movement patterns, collision detection with Mario, and appropriate behaviors when stomped or hit. Evaluate whether enemies respond differently based on Mario's state (small, big, fire). Deduct 3 points if enemies move but don't interact, 5 points if enemy variety is limited to one type, and 5 points if death/respawn mechanics are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the implementation includes pipes, blocks (breakable and question), coins, and end-level flags/castles. Score 10 if the level design is comprehensive with multiple stages or progressive difficulty, 5 if there's only a single basic level, and 0 if there's just a flat surface with minimal objects.",

Check if player progress is maintained between levels and if there's a proper restart mechanism. Deduct 3 points for each missing component (score, lives, timer, game states).

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid input sequences, browser resizing, performance degradation on slower devices) and provide graceful fallbacks. Code with strong robustness should prevent game-breaking bugs like falling through platforms or getting stuck in walls. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if the game breaks easily.",

Local multiplayer option). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to Mario gameplay (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that cause lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no optimization for sprite rendering or collision detection.

Deduct 3 points for blurry sprites, 5 points for inconsistent art style, and 5 points for poorly positioned UI elements that obscure gameplay. The full score is 10 points.",
