I want to create a game like Sekiro's sword-clashing gameplay. Can you help me generate the core code for sword combat and deflection mechanisms?",

      "description": "Review whether the code includes a complete sword combat system with attack and defense mechanics similar to Sekiro. Check for proper implementation of player input handling, attack animations, hitbox detection, and damage calculation. Score 0 if core combat is missing, 5 if basic attack/defense exists, and 10 if the system captures Sekiro's nuanced combat feel with different attack types.",

Check for visual feedback effects, sound cues, and the posture/stagger system that increases with failed deflections. Scoring: 0 points if deflection is absent, 5 points for basic parry without posture mechanics, 10 points for a complete implementation with timing-based difficulty and posture buildup effects.",

Check if posture regeneration mechanics and visual indicators are present. Award 0 points if absent, 5 points for basic implementation, and 10 points if it includes varying recovery rates based on health and enemy types.",

Verify that the AI has different states (aggressive, defensive, recovery) and realistic reaction times. Score 0 if AI is missing, 5 if basic attack patterns exist, and 10 if the AI demonstrates complex behavior with pattern recognition of player tactics.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to sword combat (e.g., an excessive inventory system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., too many particle effects during deflection). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if proper optimization techniques aren't applied for performance-critical sections.
