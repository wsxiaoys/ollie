Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a Sound Reaction system.\n\n**Task**: Add a sound reaction mechanism to the game where players need to react to specific sound effects to avoid dangers or seize opportunities.\n\n**Hint**: You can play specific sound effects and set up events that require players to react quickly, such as avoiding traps or attacking enemies.\n\nPlease include comments in your code so other developers can understand your implementation process.",
