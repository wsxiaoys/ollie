  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate, professional responses. Make sure any code you provide is executable.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a **\"Super Mario Style Game\" game introduction**\n\n**Game Introduction:**\nThis game is a classic side-scrolling platform action game inspired by the \"Super Mario\" series, known for its simple controls and adventure-filled game world. Players will take on the role of a brave adventurer, exploring colorful levels by jumping, stomping on enemies, and collecting items, while facing various challenges and enemies.\n\n**Game Features:**\n1. **Classic Platform Action**: Based on side-scrolling mechanics, players can control their character to progress through various levels using simple jump and attack operations.\n\n2. **Diverse Level Design**: The game features multiple levels with different themes and difficulties. Each level is filled with unique obstacles, enemies, and puzzles that require players to skillfully use their abilities and strategies to complete.\n\n**Gameplay:**\nPlayers need to control their character to jump over obstacles, defeat enemies with attacks, and collect treasures and secret items during exploration. Each level has different objectives and challenges.\n\n**Game Tips:**\n- **Precise Jumping and Attacking**: Learn to control the character's jumping height to avoid traps and defeat enemies.\n\n- **Observation and Planning**: Before starting each level, observe the map layout and enemy distribution to develop adaptive strategies and plan your path.\n\nThis game not only preserves the classic elements and challenges of the \"Super Mario\" series but also brings players new adventure experiences and fun. Whether you're looking to revisit the classics or seeking a fresh experience, you'll find satisfaction in this game. Include some comments in your code to help other developers understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the HTML/JavaScript code creates a visually appealing and informative game introduction page that effectively showcases the Super Mario style game. Check for sections that present game features, gameplay mechanics, and tips as specified in the requirements. Score 0 if the introduction is missing key elements, 5 if basic information is presented in a plain format, and 10 if the introduction is comprehensive with proper styling and organization.",

Check if these elements are properly rendered and positioned.

Review if the demonstrations accurately represent the described mechanics. Deduct 5 points if no gameplay demonstrations are provided, and 3 points if the demonstrations are static or don't clearly explain the mechanics. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the game introduction (e.g., full game implementation instead of just the introduction) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects or animations).
