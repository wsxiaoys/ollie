      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the basic parkour mechanics including running, jumping, sliding, and obstacle collision detection. Check if the Giant Squid protagonist has proper movement physics (gravity, acceleration, and inertia). Score 0 if core mechanics are missing, 5 if basic movement exists but feels unnatural, and 10 if the movement system is polished with smooth animation transitions.",

Check if airplanes have appropriate flight patterns and if turtle shells have consistent behavior (e.g., can they be dodged, jumped over, or used as weapons?). Deduct 5 points if elements are merely decorative without gameplay function, deduct 3 points if their behavior is inconsistent. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate whether the character has unique abilities fitting a squid (e.g., tentacle-based movement, ink defense).

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to parkour gameplay (e.g., an unnecessary inventory system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that cause framerate drops).
