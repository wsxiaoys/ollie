Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement a Sliding Challenge game where players can slide down slopes or on icy surfaces and need to avoid obstacles. You can set the sliding speed and direction, and design sliding routes that require quick reactions.\n\nPlease include comments in your code to help other developers understand your implementation process.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the physics of sliding (acceleration/deceleration) through HTML/JavaScript, and whether it handles different surface types (slopes vs. icy surfaces). Score 0 if the sliding mechanics are not implemented, 5 if only basic sliding is implemented without differentiation between surfaces, and 10 if the physics feels realistic with proper friction coefficients for different surfaces.",

      "description": "Check whether collision detection with obstacles is properly implemented, and whether the player feedback on collision is clear. Obstacles should have varying difficulty levels and require different reaction speeds. Deduct 5 points if collision detection is inaccurate or buggy, 3 points if all obstacles have the same difficulty level, and 2 points if visual feedback on collision is poor. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the controls for adjusting sliding speed and direction are intuitive and responsive. The game should provide clear visual feedback when changing direction or speed. Deduct 5 points if the controls feel sluggish, 3 points if there's no visual feedback on direction changes, and 5 points if the control system is too complex for a sliding game.

Routes should include varied challenges and interesting path choices. Deduct 5 points if the routes are too linear without branches, 3 points if the difficulty progression is too steep or nonexistent, and 3 points if the routes lack visual distinction.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to sliding gameplay (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that cause lag).
