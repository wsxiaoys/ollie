      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the essential Super Mario mechanics including player movement (running, jumping), collisions with platforms and enemies, power-ups (mushroom, fire flower, star), and level transitions. Score 0 if the core gameplay is not implemented, 5 if only basic movement and platforms are implemented, and 10 if all classic mechanics including pipe travel and enemy interactions are fully included.",

Deduct 3 points if enemies don't have proper movement patterns, 3 points if enemy-player interactions are inconsistent with classic Super Mario mechanics, and 4 points if less than three enemy types are implemented.

Check for multiple levels with increasing difficulty and variety. Deduct 5 points if the level design is hardcoded without a reusable system, 3 points if environmental hazards (pits, lava) are missing, and 2 points if there's no level progression.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Super Mario (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects).
