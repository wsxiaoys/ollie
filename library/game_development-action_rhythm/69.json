Make sure the generated code is executable and demonstrable.\n\nPlease use HTML and JavaScript to implement an animation transition: enable character animation switching between different states, such as walking, running, jumping, and other different actions.\n[CHAT_SEP]Please optimize the above game response and add some comments in the code so that other developers can understand your implementation process.",

      "title": "Is the character animation system properly implemented?",
      "description": "Check if the code implements the core animation system with state management for different character actions (walking, running, jumping). Evaluate the state machine architecture, handling transitions between animation states cleanly. Score 0 if no state transitions exist, 5 if only basic transitions are implemented, and 10 if all specified actions with seamless transitions are included.",

      "description": "Review the implementation of sprite animation technique (whether using sprite sheets, CSS animations, or canvas-based animation). Check for proper frame sequencing, timing control, and animation loops. Deduct 5 points if animation frames are incorrectly sequenced, 3 points if timing control is inconsistent. Full score requires proper sprite resource management and optimization.",

Check for interpolation techniques, easing functions, and blending between animations. Deduct 5 points for abrupt transitions, 3 points for inconsistent animation speeds. 10 points for natural, realistic transitions that follow physical movement principles.",

Check if there's debouncing for rapid input changes and proper handling of simultaneous inputs. Deduct 5 points if input lag exceeds 100ms, 3 points if certain input combinations cause animation glitches. Full score requires responsive and intuitive controls.",

Code with strong robustness should implement error boundaries and fallback animations. Deduct 5 points for each unhandled edge case. Give 10 points if all common exceptions are properly managed with graceful fallbacks.",
