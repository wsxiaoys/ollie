Score 0 if core game mechanics are missing, 5 if basic jumping is implemented but lacks other features, and 10 if all mechanics from the original Chrome dinosaur game are present.",

Deduct 5 points if using setTimeout/setInterval instead of requestAnimationFrame, 3 points if frame rate inconsistencies are visible, and 3 points if there's no delta time calculation for movement.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the dinosaur game (e.g., unnecessary UI elements) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems).
