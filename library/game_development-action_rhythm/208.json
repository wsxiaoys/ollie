      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements stick figure characters with proper joint connections and movement capabilities. Check if the animation includes proper physics for realistic movements (e.g., gravity, momentum). Score 0 if stick figures are not properly rendered, 5 if basic static figures are drawn but animation is limited, and 10 if fully articulated stick figures with smooth movements are implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of combat mechanics between stick figures. Check for collision detection between figures, attack animations, defensive moves, and health/damage systems. Score 0 if no interaction exists, 5 if basic collision is implemented but combat feels unrealistic, and 10 if there's a comprehensive combat system with various attacks, defenses, and believable physics.",

      "description": "Assess the implementation of keyboard/mouse controls that allow users to manipulate at least one of the stick figures. Check for responsiveness (inputs registered within 100ms), intuitiveness of controls, and whether instructions are provided. Deduct 5 points if controls are limited to basic movements, 3 points if there are no alternative control schemes. Full score requires comprehensive controls for both movement and combat actions.",

Check for memory leaks during long gameplay. Deduct 5 points for frame rate issues, 5 points if there's no proper game state handling, and 3 points if animation timing is inconsistent.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code handles common edge cases (browser compatibility, window resizing, input device variations, performance degradation). Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle these scenarios with fallback mechanisms. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling and browser compatibility, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if the code breaks easily under common variations.",

Different fighting styles for stick figures 4. Sound effects synchronized with animations). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Complex effects that impact performance without adding value to the core experience. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if redundant code significantly impacts core animation performance.",
