      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements essential game elements: paddle control, ball physics, brick collision detection, and score tracking. Score 0 if the core mechanics are missing, 5 if only basic collisions work, and 10 if all expected features (varying brick types, ball physics, proper boundary handling) are present.",

      "description": "Evaluate ball physics implementation including angle reflection on paddle hits, proper wall bouncing, and brick collision accuracy. Check for edge cases like corner hits and multi-brick collisions. Deduct 3 points for unrealistic physics, 5 points for major collision bugs. Full score requires smooth, realistic physics with proper acceleration handling.",

Examine if there's a proper game loop with level transitions. Award 10 points for comprehensive level systems with increasing challenge, 5 points for basic progression, 0 for single-state gameplay.",

Look for proper visual feedback when acquiring power-ups and their effect timing management. Award 10 points for diverse, well-balanced power-up system, 5 for basic power-ups, 0 if none exist.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively manage these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to brick-breaking (e.g., unintegrated mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems causing lag). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state is overused or if game loop timing isn't handled properly; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high; deduct 5 points if there's no separation between game mechanics and rendering.

Deduct 3 points for inconsistent visual elements, 5 points for poor readability or usability issues, and 5 points for visual elements that hinder gameplay. The full score is 10 points.",
