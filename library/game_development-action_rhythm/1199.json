      "title": "Is the Snake game core mechanics fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the game grid system, snake movement logic, food generation, collision detection (wall/self), and score calculation. Check if the snake grows correctly after eating food and if the game ends properly on collision. Score 0 if core game loop is missing, 5 if only basic movement is implemented, and 10 if all classic Snake game rules are fully functional.",

      "title": "Is the control system responsive and intuitive?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether keyboard controls (arrow keys/WASD) are properly implemented with direction change validation (preventing reverse direction causing instant death). Check for smooth input handling without lag or missed keystrokes during rapid direction changes. Deduct 5 points if input buffering is missing, and 3 points if there's noticeable input delay. Full score requires flawless control responsiveness.",

      "title": "Is the game timing and difficulty progression well-designed?",
      "description": "Check if the game uses consistent frame rate or timer-based movement, and whether speed increases appropriately as score grows. Evaluate if the difficulty curve is balanced and engaging. Deduct 5 points if movement is inconsistent or jerky, 3 points if speed progression is too aggressive or absent. Requires smooth 60fps performance and logical difficulty scaling.",

      "description": "Verify implementation of complete game states: start screen, active gameplay, pause functionality, game over screen, and restart capability. Check for proper state transitions and memory cleanup. Deduct 5 points if pause/resume is missing, 3 points if game over handling is incomplete, and 5 points if memory leaks occur during state transitions.",

Code should gracefully handle unexpected situations without crashing or corrupting game state. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic robustness, and 0 points if no exception handling exists.",

Sound effects and visual feedback 5. Mobile touch controls). Add 2-3 points for each well-implemented feature that genuinely improves user experience (maximum 10 points).",

Performance-heavy effects that don't add value (e.g., complex particle systems). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and deduct 10 points if redundant code interferes with core game performance or clarity.",

Deduct 5 points for poor code structure or excessive global variables; deduct 5 points for high code duplication (>30%); deduct 3 points for inconsistent coding style. Full score requires clean, maintainable architecture.",

Deduct 3 points for poor color choices, 5 points for cluttered layout, and 5 points for hard-to-read text or game elements.",

Deduct 5 points for choppy animations, 3 points for missing visual feedback on key actions, and 5 points for inconsistent or jarring visual transitions.",
