      "description": "Check if the Android WebView is correctly initialized with proper settings for JavaScript, DOM storage, and file access. Verify if security settings are configured (e.g., setAllowFileAccess, setAllowContentAccess). Deduct 5 points for missing essential configurations that enable Vue.js to work properly; deduct 3 points if security best practices are not followed. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to scanning (e.g., unnecessary analytics) 3. Fancy effects that affect scanning performance (e.g., excessive animations during scanning).
