Be sure to ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Can an xbuild h5 vue project that generates a mobile APP create a floating window that displays over other applications?",

      "title": "Is the cross-platform capability accurately explained?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the response clearly distinguishes between WebView/H5 limitations and native app capabilities regarding system-level floating windows. Check if it explains that Vue-based H5 apps cannot create OS-level floating windows that display over other applications without native integration. Deduct 5 points for ambiguous explanations, 10 points for incorrect technical information about WebView capabilities. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the solution provides a complete native bridge implementation (e.g., using JSBridge, Capacitor, or other native plugins) that connects the Vue application with native functionality required for floating windows. Evaluate if the code includes both the JavaScript interface and corresponding native code (Java/Kotlin for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS). Score 0 if missing entirely, 5 for partial implementation, and 10 for complete implementation with proper documentation.",

Evaluate the practicality and implementation completeness of these alternatives. Score 0 if no alternatives are provided, 5 for conceptual alternatives without implementation, and 10 for fully implemented alternatives with code examples.",

Evaluate explanation of iOS limitations and workarounds. Deduct 3 points for each platform with missing permission handling, and 5 points for incorrect permission information.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to floating windows (e.g., unnecessary analytics) 3. Performance-heavy effects that aren't essential.
