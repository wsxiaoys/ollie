      "title": "Is the drag and drop file upload functionality fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the core drag and drop API (using HTML5 dragenter, dragover, dragleave, drop events). Check if it prevents default browser behavior for drag events and handles file objects correctly from the DataTransfer object. Score 0 if drag events are not implemented, 5 if only basic file dropping works without visual feedback, and 10 if it handles all drag states properly with appropriate event propagation control.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the implementation leverages Vue 3's Composition API (ref, reactive, computed, watch, lifecycle hooks) properly rather than just using Options API. Check for proper reactivity handling for the file state and upload progress. Deduct 5 points if Vue 3 specific features are not utilized, 3 points if reactive state management is inconsistent. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if there's no file validation, 3 points if validation exists but without user feedback, and 2 points if progress tracking is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as unsupported file types, extremely large files, network interruption, browser compatibility issues). Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to file upload (e.g., complex animation systems) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary DOM manipulations during upload). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's poor separation of concerns.

Deduct 5 points for delayed feedback during dragging, 3 points for jarring state transitions, and 5 points for confusing or missing upload status indicators. The full score is 10 points.",
