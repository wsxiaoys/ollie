      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements Word document parsing through Vue.js components, including support for multiple formats (.docx, .doc), proper handling of document structure (paragraphs, tables, images, formatting), and preservation of original document styling. Score 0 if basic import is not working, 5 if only plain text import is supported, and 10 if complete document structure and formatting are preserved during import.",

Verify real-time content synchronization and cursor position management. Deduct 5 points if table editing is missing, 3 points if formatting toolbar is incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for version history tracking, conflict resolution for concurrent edits, and data integrity validation. Deduct 5 points if auto-save is missing, 3 points if no version tracking exists.

Verify support for multiple export formats (.docx, .pdf), preservation of formatting, images, tables, and document metadata. Evaluate export speed and file size optimization. Deduct 5 points if formatting is lost during export, 3 points if images are not properly embedded. Give 10 points if export maintains 100% visual fidelity.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to document editing (e.g., built-in games or social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during typing).

Deduct 5 points if Vue reactivity is misused or component lifecycle is not properly managed; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
