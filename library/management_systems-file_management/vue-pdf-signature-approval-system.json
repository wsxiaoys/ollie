  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the code you generate is executable. I am a frontend engineer using Vue 3 and Element Plus. As shown in the image, the requirement is to have PDF display on the left side and signature with approval comments on the right side. This involves multiple-page PDF document approval, incorporating signatures and approval comments where the signature is an image and the approval comment is text. After completing the approval, a new PDF needs to be generated. Please think about how to implement this and provide code.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements PDF rendering using libraries like pdf.js or vue-pdf, supports multi-page navigation, zoom controls, and proper viewport handling. Check if page thumbnails, page jumping, and smooth scrolling between pages are implemented. Score 0 if PDF cannot be displayed, 5 if only basic single-page display works, and 10 if full multi-page navigation with zoom and responsive layout is implemented.",

Check if signature placement, resizing, and comment threading are functional. Deduct 5 points if signature image handling is missing, 3 points if comment positioning is inaccurate.

      "description": "Check whether the system accurately maps UI coordinates to PDF coordinate system, handles different zoom levels and page rotations correctly, and maintains annotation positions when switching between pages. Evaluate if coordinate transformation handles viewport changes and maintains precision. Deduct 5 points if annotations drift during zoom, 3 points if positioning fails on page rotation.

      "description": "Assess whether the code implements PDF generation using libraries like jsPDF or PDFLib to merge original PDF with signatures and comments, maintains original document quality, and handles multi-page export correctly. Check if generated PDF preserves all annotations and maintains proper formatting. Deduct 5 points if export quality is degraded, 5 points if annotations are lost during generation.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Unnecessary UI components unrelated to PDF approval (e.g., built-in media players, unrelated widgets) 3. Performance-heavy visual effects that slow down PDF rendering (e.g., excessive animations during page transitions). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core PDF functionality is interfered with by redundant code.",
