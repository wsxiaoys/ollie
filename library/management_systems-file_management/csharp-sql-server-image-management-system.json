  "question": "You are a code expert. Please utilize your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable for demonstration. Please design an image management system using Visual Studio C# that can store images from a folder into a SQL Server database table through a form interface, and also read images from the SQL Server table and display them one by one. How should this be implemented?",

      "description": "Review whether the code includes appropriate table schema with image data type (varbinary/image), proper connection string management, and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Check if error handling for database connections is implemented. Score 0 if database connectivity is missing, 5 if basic connection exists but has security issues, 10 if fully implemented with transaction support and connection pooling.",

Check for exception handling, input validation, and graceful degradation. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points.

Function modules unrelated to image management (e.g., a built-in web browser) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations during database operations).
