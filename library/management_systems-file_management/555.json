Design a timeline-based file management system where all files uploaded by users generate a timeline based on upload times. Users can quickly find specific files by dragging a timeline slider.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements file upload functionality with proper validation, storage handling, and timestamp recording. Check if the timeline organization is implemented with appropriate data structures for efficient retrieval based on timestamps. Score 0 if core upload functionality is missing, 5 if basic upload works but lacks proper timestamp handling, and 10 if the system includes complete file metadata tracking with reliable timestamp-based organization.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of the slider component that allows users to navigate the timeline. Check for smooth dragging functionality, proper event handling, responsive updates, and visual feedback during interaction. The slider should accurately represent the time distribution of files. Deduct 5 points if the slider doesn't update the file view in real-time, and 3 points if it lacks visual cues about file density across different time periods. The full score is 10 points.",

Assess if the filtering mechanism correctly identifies and displays files within the selected time range. Examine whether the system handles time zones properly and provides clear temporal context. Deduct 5 points if filtering has noticeable lag (>200ms), and 3 points if time range selection lacks precision controls. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if these operations integrate properly with the timeline system and maintain data consistency. Deduct 5 points if basic file operations are missing, and 3 points if operations don't update the timeline view accordingly. Give 10 points if fully implemented with seamless timeline integration.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to timeline-based file management (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down timeline navigation).
