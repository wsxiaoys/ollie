Make sure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration purposes. I indeed use a webpage to implement consistent software categorization and image display. Various downloaded software is stored in the D:\\Download folder. Please write code to implement this, ensuring the webpage is aesthetically pleasing and elegant.",

Check if it handles various edge cases like permissions, locked files, and large directories.0 points if no file scanning functionality exists, 5 points for basic extension-based categorization, 10 points for comprehensive detection including content signature analysis and proper error handling.",

Check if the interface follows a grid layout, employs appropriate thumbnails/icons, and provides visual cues for software categories.Deduct 5 points for inconsistent visual language across categories, 3 points for poor information hierarchy, and 5 points for lack of visual differentiation between categories. 10 points for a comprehensive, well-designed categorization system.",
