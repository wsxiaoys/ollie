      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements photo selection from the album, including handling permissions, supporting multiple photo selection, and providing image previews. Check if there are file type and size validations, and if users can deselect/reselect photos. Score 0 if selection functionality is missing, 5 if basic selection works but lacks validations, and 10 if all features including preview and validation are fully implemented.",

Check if there's proper error handling for server-side rejections. Deduct 5 points if upload progress isn't shown, 3 points if there's no retry mechanism, and 2 points if network transitions aren't handled. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to photo uploading (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during upload).
