      "description": "Review whether the code implements a complete photo upload system, including file selection interface, MIME type validation, and progress tracking. Score 0 if the core upload logic is missing, 5 if basic upload is implemented without validation, and 10 if it includes file type checking, size limits (typically 10-20MB per image), and proper error handling for failed uploads.",

Deduct 3 points if there's no cancel option for in-progress uploads, 4 points if there's no parallel upload optimization, and 5 points if the code doesn't handle partial batch failures gracefully.

Deduct 5 points if no content delivery optimization is included (like CDN integration), 3 points if download resumption isn't supported, and 5 points if there's no mechanism to handle expired download links.

Deduct 5 points if camera capture isn't supported alongside gallery selection, 5 points if permissions aren't properly requested and verified, and 3 points if device orientation and EXIF data aren't preserved.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as unstable network conditions, insufficient storage space, invalid file formats, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Automatic creation of photo albums based on time/location 3. Background upload that works even when the app is minimized).

Function modules unrelated to photo management (e.g., a built-in social network) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations during upload/download). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no proper logging mechanism for debugging upload/download failures.
