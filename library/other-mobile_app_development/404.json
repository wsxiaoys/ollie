Check if the page implements proper state management using @State, @Prop, or @Link decorators. Score 0 if basic page structure is missing, 5 if only basic structure exists without proper state management, and 10 if complete HarmonyOS page architecture is implemented with proper lifecycle and state management.",

Code with strong robustness should include try-catch blocks for navigation operations and proper error handling.

Unnecessary UI components unrelated to the navigation task 3. Over-complicated animations or effects that don't serve the core functionality.
