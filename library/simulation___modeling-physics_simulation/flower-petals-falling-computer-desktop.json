      "title": "Is the flower petal animation system properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the flower petal floating physics with realistic gravity, wind effects, and natural randomization of movement paths. Check for proper use of requestAnimationFrame or similar timing mechanisms. Score 0 if no animation is implemented, 5 if basic falling animation exists, and 10 if petals exhibit natural, varied falling patterns with proper physics simulation.",

      "title": "Does the implementation support desktop integration?",
      "description": "Evaluate if the code creates a transparent overlay that properly integrates with the desktop environment (using Electron, browser features in kiosk mode, or appropriate system APIs). Check if it allows normal desktop usage while petals are falling. Deduct 5 points if it only works in a browser window, and 3 points if it interferes with normal desktop operations. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code allows for multiple petal types, colors, sizes, and shapes. Examine if it includes at least 3 different flower types with appropriate seasonal variations. Score 0 if there's only one type of petal, 5 if there are a few variations, and 10 if there's extensive customization with realistic petal rendering using SVG or Canvas.",

      "description": "Check if the code implements object pooling, proper garbage collection, and throttling mechanisms to prevent memory leaks and CPU overuse. Verify that it scales appropriately based on screen size and system capabilities. Deduct 5 points if performance degrades over time, and 3 points if it doesn't adjust for system load.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as window resize, background/foreground transitions, different screen resolutions, etc.) and provide graceful error handling. Code with strong robustness should adapt to various environments without breaking, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Day/night cycle or weather effects 3. Seasonal variations or holiday themes). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Feature modules unrelated to petal animation (e.g., unnecessary UI controls) 3. Effects that harm performance without adding value (e.g., excessive particle systems). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
