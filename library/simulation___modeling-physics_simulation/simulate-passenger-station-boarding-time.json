  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable when possible. Please help me write a small program that simulates the walking process of passengers from arriving at a station to boarding a vehicle, and outputs the time passengers spend at the station.",

      "title": "Is the passenger arrival simulation properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements passenger arrival patterns (random, scheduled, or based on statistical distributions). Check if arrival rates vary by time of day and if the simulation handles peak/off-peak scenarios. Score 0 if arrival logic is missing, 5 if only basic constant arrival rate is implemented, and 10 if realistic arrival patterns with variability are fully modeled.",

Check if the model accounts for walking speeds, congestion effects, and path-finding algorithms. Deduct 5 points if spatial modeling is oversimplified, and 3 points if passenger behaviors like stopping at information boards are not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify if the simulation handles scenarios like full vehicles or missed connections. Score 0 if boarding logic is missing, 5 if only basic boarding is implemented, and 10 if it includes realistic boarding behaviors including priority boarding and capacity management.",

Function modules unrelated to passenger flow simulation (e.g., unnecessary weather simulation) 3. Overly complex algorithms that don't improve accuracy.
