      "title": "Is the solar system model astronomically accurate?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements accurate relative scaling of planetary sizes, orbital distances, and orbital periods. Check if the sun is properly centered and planets rotate at different speeds according to astronomical data. Score 0 if planets are randomly positioned, 5 if basic orbital mechanics are implemented but with inaccurate scaling, and 10 if the model closely resembles actual astronomical proportions (with acceptable artistic license).",

      "description": "Check if the animation uses requestAnimationFrame() or appropriate timing mechanisms rather than setTimeout/setInterval for smoother rendering. Assess if orbital motion is fluid (minimum 30fps) and whether the code implements proper circular/elliptical paths using mathematical functions (sine/cosine or elliptical equations). Deduct 5 points for jerky animations or frame drops, and 3 points if orbital paths are visibly polygonal rather than smooth curves. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if no interactivity exists, 3 points if interactions lack visual feedback, and 5 points if interactions break the simulation.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the solar system (e.g., unnecessary UI elements) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that slow down the animation). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core animation is interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance considerations are evident for complex animations.
