Verify that the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches are correctly assigned according to traditional Chinese calendar calculations. Score 0 if core calculation logic is missing, 5 if basic pillar formation exists with minor errors, and 10 if calculations fully comply with traditional BaZi principles including solar calendar adjustments.",

Check for accurate implementation of starting age calculation, cycle transitions, and proper sequencing of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches in the luck pillars.
