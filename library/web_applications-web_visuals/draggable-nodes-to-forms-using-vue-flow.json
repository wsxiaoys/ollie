Create an example of draggable nodes to forms using Vue Flow.\n\n(1) The left side of the page is a node placement area, displaying the node types I can drag in small icon format.\n(2) The right side of the page is a canvas area. When nodes are dragged onto it and released, they become input forms.",

      "description": "Review whether the code correctly implements Vue Flow's node dragging mechanism, including drag source configuration, drop target handling, and node type registration. Check if custom node components are properly defined with Vue Flow's node interface. Score 0 if core dragging functionality is missing, 5 if only basic drag-drop works without proper Vue Flow integration, and 10 if all Vue Flow dragging features are correctly implemented with proper event handling.",

Check if form field types (text, number, select, etc.) are properly mapped to node types, form validation is implemented, and form data binding works correctly. Deduct 5 points if forms lack proper validation, 3 points if data binding is incomplete. Full score requires complete form functionality with proper Vue reactivity.",

Evaluate if the layout is responsive and maintains proper proportions. Deduct 5 points if layout breaks on different screen sizes, 3 points if sidebar icons are poorly organized.

Check if nodes can be repositioned after being dropped, form data is preserved during interactions, and the overall canvas state can be serialized/deserialized. Deduct 5 points if node positions aren't persistent, 3 points if form data is lost during operations. Full score requires complete state management.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like dragging outside canvas bounds, invalid node types, and component mounting failures. Give 10 points if fully robust, 5 points if average robustness, and 0 points if no exception handling.",

Form template saving/loading 4. Drag-to-connect form validation rules). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).

Function modules unrelated to form building (e.g., built-in calendar widget unrelated to forms) 3. Fancy effects that affect drag performance (e.g., heavy animations during drag operations).
