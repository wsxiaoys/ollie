Score 0 if basic structure is missing, 5 if structure exists but with improper semantics, and 10 if properly structured with semantic HTML.",

It should include proper animation transitions, accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation), and contact information.

Check for WebGL/Canvas/CSS animations that create horror atmosphere (fog, flickering lights, floating elements, etc.). Effects should be optimized for performance (using requestAnimationFrame, proper canvas rendering). Deduct 5 points if effects cause visible performance issues, 3 points if animations are basic/generic. The full score is 10 points.",

Audio should preload for seamless playback and include fallback formats.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to a horror game website (e.g., unrelated social media features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down the page).
