      "description": "Check whether the Cesium map instance is correctly initialized with proper viewport configuration, appropriate default camera position targeting Zhengzhou (coordinates approximately 34.7°N, 113.6°E), and essential Cesium widgets. Score 0 if map initialization fails, 5 if basic initialization exists but with incorrect Zhengzhou positioning, and 10 if initialization includes proper Zhengzhou focus with appropriate altitude and angle settings.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes proper configuration for offline tile sets, with correct paths to local terrain and imagery assets specific to Zhengzhou boundaries. Check if there's proper tile caching mechanism and local resource management. Deduct 5 points if only partial offline capabilities are implemented, 8 points if offline mode is mentioned but not functionally implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code follows Vue2 best practices with proper component lifecycle methods (especially for Cesium resource management in mounted/beforeDestroy hooks), proper prop validation, emitted events, and a cleanly encapsulated component structure. Check for memory leak prevention with proper destruction of Cesium entities. Deduct 3 points for each missing critical lifecycle management aspect, and 5 points if Vue reactivity is not properly integrated with Cesium. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper event handling of user interactions and appropriate visual feedback. Score 0 if no controls are implemented, 5 if only basic map navigation exists, and 10 if comprehensive controls with Zhengzhou-specific features (like district selection) are included.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Zhengzhou mapping (e.g., support for other cities without proper abstraction) 3. Heavy features that affect offline performance (e.g., unnecessary high-resolution textures).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or Cesium instances are not properly encapsulated; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if offline resources are not properly managed in the build process.
