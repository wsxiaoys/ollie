  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration purposes. Nezha is the protagonist in the animated films \"Ne Zha: Birth of the Demon Child\" and \"Ne Zha: The Devil Child Returns to the Sea\" directed by Jiaozi, as well as related works.\n\nNezha is the third son of Li Jing and Lady Yin. He has a rebellious, mischievous, and impulsive personality, yet remains kind and just. Because he was reincarnated from a demon pill, he is misunderstood by people, feels lonely inside, and craves acceptance.\n\nHe has straight bangs, two small buns on top of his head, large panda eyes with heavy eye makeup, and somewhat frightening rows of teeth. He often displays a wicked smile with a hint of cuteness. He wears a golden collar around his neck, a red vest with lotus patterns, brown three-quarter length pants with flame patterns, and a yellow belt. He is a chaotic \"demon child\" who mistakenly came to the mortal world causing endless trouble. At birth, because the spirit pearl was stolen by Shen Gongbao, he became the reincarnation of the demon pill. Initially, Nezha faced discrimination, rejection, mockery, and hostility from the people of Chentang Pass because he was a demon pill, but as the story progresses, he gradually gains acceptance from the people.\n\nPlease use CSS preprocessing to create two files based on the text above: one HTML file and one LESS file.",

      "description": "Check if the code creates a visual representation of Nezha with the specific characteristics mentioned: straight bangs, two small buns, panda eyes with heavy makeup, teeth showing in a wicked smile, golden collar, red vest with lotus patterns, brown pants with flame patterns, and yellow belt. Score 0 if the character is not implemented at all, 5 if only basic features are included, and 10 if all detailed characteristics are present with artistic quality.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code leverages LESS features effectively: using variables for color schemes related to Nezha (red, gold, brown), implementing nesting for better organization, utilizing mixins for repeated styling patterns, and employing other LESS-specific functionalities like operations or functions. Deduct 3 points if only basic LESS features are used, 5 points if it's mostly just CSS with minimal LESS advantages, and 10 points for comprehensive LESS implementation with clear organization.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code implements animations that represent Nezha's rebellious and mischievous yet kind personality. Look for animations like flame effects, hovering or movement animations that suggest impulsiveness, and transitions that reflect his character development. Score 0 if no animations are present, 5 if basic animations exist, and 10 if thoughtful animations that meaningfully represent the character's traits are implemented.",

Verify if media queries are implemented, if relative units are used appropriately, and if the layout adapts well without breaking. Deduct 5 points if major responsive features are missing, and 3 points if adaptation is limited to only certain screen sizes. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as slow loading, missing assets, browser compatibility issues, etc.) and provides fallbacks or graceful degradation. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Unnecessary elements or styling unrelated to Nezha's character 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core visualization is interfered with by redundant code.",
