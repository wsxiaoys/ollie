      "description": "Review whether the code correctly positions a popup window in the center of the screen using proper CSS positioning techniques (absolute positioning with top/left 50% and transform translate). Check if the window has proper styling (borders, background, shadow effects) and is responsive on different screen sizes. Score 0 if no popup is implemented, 5 if it's basic but fixed-size, and 10 if it's fully responsive and properly styled.",

      "description": "Evaluate the spinning animation implementation - check for CSS animation/transition properties with keyframes or JavaScript-based animation. The animation should be smooth (60fps), have appropriate duration (1-3s per rotation), and proper easing. Animations should use hardware acceleration (transform instead of position changes). Deduct 5 points if the animation is jerky, 3 points if it lacks easing, and 2 points if it's CPU-intensive.",

Text should have sufficient contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1), appropriate font size (16px+), and should indicate loading progress clearly.

Check for timeout handling (showing error message after excessive loading time), ability to cancel loading, and smooth transition when loading completes.

Unnecessary decorative elements that distract from the loading state 3. Heavy effects that affect performance (e.g., complex particle effects during loading). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global scope pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance considerations exist (like requestAnimationFrame for animations).
