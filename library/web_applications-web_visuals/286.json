Please provide an example of a GIS project implemented with Vue 3 and Vite, with layer functionality supporting both 2D and 3D. The map should be implemented based on OpenLayers and Cesium.",

      "description": "Check whether the code correctly configures a Vue 3 project using Vite build system, with proper directory structure following Vue best practices. Review the package.json for correct dependencies (vue, vite, typescript if applicable). Verify the proper configuration of essential plugins like vue-router for navigation, pinia/vuex for state management, and any GIS-specific plugins. Score 0 if Vue 3 + Vite setup is missing, 5 if basic setup exists but lacks organization, and 10 if project structure is comprehensive with proper separation of concerns.",

Check if both libraries are properly imported, initialized without conflicts, and have appropriate version compatibility. Verify if the code includes a seamless toggle mechanism between 2D and 3D views while preserving the current viewport position. Deduct 5 points if only one library is implemented, 3 points if libraries are implemented but poorly integrated, and 2 points if the 2D/3D transition is jarring or loses state. Full score requires both libraries working harmoniously with smooth transitions.",

Check for layer types support (vector, raster, WMS, WMTS, GeoJSON, KML), layer operations (add, remove, toggle visibility, opacity control, reordering), and consistent layer representation across both OpenLayers and Cesium contexts. Deduct 3 points for each missing essential layer type, 5 points if layer persistence between 2D/3D modes is absent, and 5 points if layer styling capabilities are limited. Full score requires comprehensive layer management that works identically across both mapping engines.",

Check if the code handles vector formats (GeoJSON, KML, TopoJSON), raster formats (GeoTIFF, raster tiles), and services (WMS, WMTS, WFS). Verify if the code implements proper data loading patterns with error handling, caching strategies, and on-demand loading. Deduct 3 points for each major format not supported, 5 points if data loading lacks error handling, and 5 points if there's no optimization for large datasets. Full score requires comprehensive format support with optimized loading strategies.",

Check for proper async operation handling, especially for map initialization and data loading. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points.

Unnecessary third-party libraries when OpenLayers/Cesium already provide the functionality 3. Overly complex custom implementations of features that are available in standard libraries.

Check if the code implements lazy loading for heavy mapping libraries, employs TypeScript for type safety, and uses proper build optimizations for map assets.
