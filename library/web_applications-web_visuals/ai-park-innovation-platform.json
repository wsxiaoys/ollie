  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable and demonstrable when possible. Help me create a webpage for \"AI Park Innovation\" - an AI platform specifically for generating industrial designs, featuring a dedicated information plaza, model integration interface, and generation interface. The page should be simple yet impressive, with the words \"AI Park Innovation\" appearing on each page.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the HTML structure follows semantic principles with proper sectioning (header, main, footer), responsive layout, and correct navigation between the three key sections (information plaza, model integration interface, and generation interface). Check if the title 'AI Park Innovation' appears consistently on each page. Score 0 if basic structure is missing, 5 if structure exists but with improper hierarchy, and 10 if perfectly structured with proper semantic HTML5 tags and responsive design principles.",

Check if dynamic content loading is implemented, if pagination or infinite scrolling works, and if the content display adapts to different screen sizes. Deduct 3 points if filtering is missing, 4 points if dynamic loading isn't implemented, and 3 points if responsiveness fails on mobile devices. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify if the interface includes model compatibility checking, parameter validation, and visual feedback during integration processes. Deduct 5 points if there's no error handling for model uploads, 3 points if parameter configuration is confusing, and 2 points if visual feedback during processes is missing.

Check if it includes progress indicators, cancellation options, and history tracking. Deduct 4 points if there's no visual preview or progress indication, 3 points if the interface lacks parameter fine-tuning, and 3 points if history/saved designs aren't accessible.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to industrial design generation (e.g., social networking functions) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down core functionality).
