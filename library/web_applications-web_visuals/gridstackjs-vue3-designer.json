  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to make the generated code executable for demonstration purposes. https://gridstackjs.com/ is the official website of gridstackjs. I want to create a large screen designer based on it with: left component list, layer management, top menu bar, middle layer area, and right property configuration panel. It should allow dynamically adding and dragging Vue components, dynamically adjusting component layers, and support features like screen theme colors, background images, and responsive design. Please implement this based on Vue3 + TypeScript.",

Check if responsive breakpoints are properly defined and if the layout adapts well to different screen sizes. Deduct 3 points if any section is missing, 3 points for improper responsive design implementation, and 5 points if the panels cannot be resized or collapsed.",

Check if GridStack events are properly bound to Vue methods, if GridStack options are properly typed, and if the integration follows Vue 3 Composition API patterns. Score 10 points if fully implemented with proper type safety, 5 points if basic functionality works but with type issues, 0 points if the integration is broken or incomplete.",

Check if the drag interactions handle edge cases (grid boundaries, overlapping elements, etc.) and if the component is properly instantiated upon drop with correct properties. Evaluate if custom drag handles are implemented and if position data is properly synchronized with the state management system.

Check if there are proper validation for user inputs, error boundaries for components, and defensive programming practices. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to screen design (e.g., built-in irrelevant tools) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
