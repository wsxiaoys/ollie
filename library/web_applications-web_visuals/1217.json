      "description": "Check if the code includes appropriate API calls to a free weather service (such as OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.) with proper error handling and rate limiting considerations. The implementation should include API key management, proper request formatting, and response parsing. Deduct 5 points if error handling is missing, 3 points if there's no loading state during API calls, and 5 points if the API integration is incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper use of ref(), reactive(), watch(), watchEffect(), and onMounted(). Deduct 3 points for using Options API instead of Composition API, 5 points for global state management issues, and 3 points for improper reactivity management. The full score is 10 points.",

The components should be properly themed and responsive. Look for customized weather icons, temperature displays, and forecast layouts.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Weather alerts with push notifications 4. Weather impact on daily activities suggestions). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the interface). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
