      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements a responsive grid/layout for displaying wallpapers and includes navigation controls for browsing through the collection. Score 0 if no display mechanism exists, 5 if basic display is implemented but lacks organization, and 10 if it includes proper thumbnails, categories, and smooth navigation.",

      "description": "Check if the code includes functionality for users to preview wallpapers in full-screen mode before downloading, and whether it implements proper download functionality with appropriate file formats (JPG/PNG) and resolution options for different mobile devices. Deduct 5 points if preview is missing, and 3 points if download options are limited. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if the layout breaks on specific screen sizes and 5 points if touch interactions are poorly implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points if filtering is limited, 3 points if search doesn't support partial matching, and 4 points if there's no visual feedback during search/filter operations.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Dark/light mode toggle that affects UI and wallpaper suggestions 3. Wallpaper cropping/customization tools). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to wallpapers (e.g., a built-in calculator) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary parallax effects). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if unoptimized images cause slow loading; deduct 5 points if there's no code organization or bundling strategy.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for elements that extend beyond screen boundaries. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for choppy animations, and 5 points for interactions that don't follow platform conventions (iOS/Android). The full score is 10 points.",
