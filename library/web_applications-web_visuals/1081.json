      "description": "Review whether the code successfully implements text scrolling using NiceGUI components. Check if the text moves continuously from one side to another and wraps around correctly. Score 0 if no scrolling effect is achieved, 5 if basic movement exists but with flaws, and 10 if smooth continuous scrolling is implemented.",

Deduct 5 points if using direct DOM manipulation instead of NiceGUI APIs, 3 points if UI updates are implemented inefficiently, and 3 points if not leveraging NiceGUI's built-in capabilities for animations or UI updates.

Check if it's properly encapsulated with clean separation between marquee logic and the main application. Deduct 5 points if the component isn't reusable, and 3 points if the interface is unclear or inconsistent. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should handle these edge cases effectively, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no edge cases are handled, give 0 points.",
