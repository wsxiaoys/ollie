Check if it includes proper image loading mechanisms, error handling for broken images, and support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc.). Score 0 if basic image display is not working, 5 if only static display is implemented, and 10 if all core album features including zoom, navigation, and format support are fully functional.",

Check if metadata extraction (EXIF data) is implemented and if users can create custom albums or collections. Deduct 5 points if no search functionality exists, 3 points if sorting options are limited to basic name/date only. Full score requires comprehensive organization features with metadata support.",

Evaluate if thumbnail generation is automatic and if there's a preview before upload confirmation.

Check if the grid layout adjusts dynamically and if touch interactions are smooth.

Code with strong robustness should include retry mechanisms, graceful degradation, and proper error boundaries, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to album functionality (e.g., built-in games or unrelated widgets) 3. Excessive visual effects that impact performance (e.g., complex particle systems or heavy animations).

Check for proper error handling, memory management for large images, and performance optimization techniques. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or poor separation of concerns; deduct 5 points if memory leaks are detected during image navigation; deduct 5 points if no lazy loading or performance optimization is implemented.
