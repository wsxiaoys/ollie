      "description": "Review whether the code implements a visually appealing birthday card with teacher-themed elements (books, apples, classroom motifs, etc.) and age-appropriate design for an 85-year-old recipient. Check for large, readable fonts (minimum 18px), high contrast colors, and meaningful educational symbols. Score 0 if no thematic elements are present, 5 if basic birthday card layout exists, and 10 if fully themed with teacher-specific decorations and age-appropriate considerations.",

Verify volume controls, play/pause functionality, and track selection. Deduct 5 points if music doesn't autoplay after user interaction, 3 points if volume controls are missing, and 5 points if music selection isn't age-appropriate. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the card includes engaging but gentle animations suitable for elderly users - such as falling confetti, blooming flowers, or gentle fade-in effects for birthday messages. Animations should be smooth, not overwhelming, and enhance the emotional impact. Deduct 5 points if animations are too fast or jarring, 3 points if no interactive elements exist, and 5 points if effects don't match the celebratory theme. Full score is 10 points.",

Verify if messages appear progressively, include teaching appreciation themes, and have options for customization. Deduct 5 points if messages are generic, 3 points if no progressive reveal mechanism exists, and 5 points if content doesn't reflect the teacher profession.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to birthday celebration (e.g., games or complex navigation) 3. Overly flashy effects that might overwhelm elderly users (e.g., rapid blinking animations).
