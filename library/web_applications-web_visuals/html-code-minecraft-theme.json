Score 0 if there's no visual resemblance to Minecraft, 5 if basic blocky elements are present but lack authenticity, and 10 if the implementation convincingly recreates the game's iconic visual style including textures, colors, and proportions.",

Function modules unrelated to Minecraft (e.g., non-thematic elements) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems).
