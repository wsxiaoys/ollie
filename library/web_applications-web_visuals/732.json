Check if it includes essential Xiaohongshu UI elements like the avatar circle, like/comment buttons, and hashtag styling. Score 0 if the structure doesn't resemble Xiaohongshu at all, 5 if basic elements are present but poorly organized, and 10 if the structure precisely mirrors Xiaohongshu's format.",

Images should render directly when the HTML is loaded. Score 0 if images are implemented as external links requiring replacement, 5 if images are implemented but with poor optimization, and 10 if all images are perfectly embedded for direct screenshot capability.",

Code with strong robustness should work across different browsers and viewports, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
