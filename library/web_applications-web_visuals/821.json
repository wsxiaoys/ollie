Please let me use my professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. I'll make sure the code I provide is executable. Can you help me create a website that can preview videos? The website should include directory categories, where users can view video lists under each category and click to watch videos. It should also have video upload functionality. The directory categories are created by administrators, while others can upload and preview videos. Let's use the Vue3.js framework for the frontend.",

Check for proper directory structure (views, components, services, etc.). Score 0 if Vue3 is not used, 5 if basic implementation exists but lacks optimization, and 10 if fully implements Vue3 best practices including proper component composition and script setup syntax.",

Check for admin-only category management features (create, edit, delete, reorder).
