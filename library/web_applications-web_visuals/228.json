Check if progress tracking, error handling for network failures, and CORS handling are included. Score 0 if download fails completely, 5 if basic download works but lacks error handling, and 10 if includes progress tracking, proper headers (Content-Type: application/pdf), and comprehensive error handling.",

Check if the implementation includes proper page scaling, quality settings (devicePixelRatio consideration), and viewport configuration. Deduct 5 points if rendering quality is poor or pixelated, 3 points if scaling doesn't work properly. Full score requires crisp rendering with proper DPI handling and responsive scaling.",

Evaluate if PDF loading states are properly managed with Vue's reactivity system and if canvas references are correctly handled.

Check if bookmark/outline navigation is available for complex PDFs. Deduct 5 points if only single page display is supported, 3 points if zoom functionality is missing.

Code should provide meaningful error messages and graceful degradation. Strong robustness with comprehensive error handling gets 10 points, basic error handling gets 5 points, no exception handling gets 0 points.",
