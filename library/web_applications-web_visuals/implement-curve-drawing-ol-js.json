      "description": "Review whether the code properly initializes the OpenLayers (ol.js) map with appropriate configuration for projection, view settings, and base layers. Check if the map renders correctly with proper center coordinates and zoom level. Score 0 if map initialization is missing, 5 if basic initialization exists but with configuration issues, and 10 if fully implemented with proper configuration.",

Check for support of different curve types (Bezier, spline, arc, etc.) and proper use of ol.geom classes. Review if control points are properly handled. Score 0 if no curve implementation exists, 5 if only basic single-type curves are supported, and 10 if multiple curve types are implemented with appropriate control point handling.",

Evaluate whether proper event handling (click, drag, mouseover) is implemented for curve manipulation. Score 0 if no interaction exists, 5 if basic point-adding functionality exists but lacks editing capabilities, and 10 if comprehensive curve creation and editing is implemented with proper event handling.",

Check if the styling can be dynamically changed and if there are reasonable defaults. Score 0 if no styling is implemented, 5 if basic styling exists but lacks customization, and 10 if comprehensive styling options are available with appropriate defaults and dynamic updating.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
