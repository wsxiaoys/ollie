      "description": "Verify the implementation of the spherical projection algorithm, ensuring correct texture mapping using equirectangular projection. Check if the code includes proper handling of field of view (FOV), aspect ratio, and perspective distortion correction. Score 0 if no spherical projection is implemented, 5 if basic projection exists with inaccuracies, and 10 if the projection correctly renders 360Â° imagery with proper distortion handling.",

Check for smooth damping effects, proper calculation of rotation angles based on input deltas, and prevention of gimbal lock. Look for inertia implementation for natural movement. Deduct 5 points if only one input method is supported, 3 points if interaction feels jerky or unnatural, and 2 points if edge cases (like rapid movements) aren't handled.",

Check if the implementation includes proper permission handling, fallbacks for unsupported devices, and calibration options. Verify that orientation changes are translated correctly to camera rotation. Score 0 if completely missing, 5 if implemented but with significant limitations (e.g., works only in certain orientations), and 10 if fully functional with smooth and accurate tracking.",

Verify that memory management is considered for large textures.

Code with strong robustness should detect WebGL support, handle various aspect ratios, and manage resource limitations gracefully. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for partial error handling, and 0 points if exceptions are unmanaged.",
