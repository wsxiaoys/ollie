      "description": "Review whether the code correctly initializes a map using a standard mapping API (like Google Maps, Leaflet, or Mapbox), with proper API keys and configuration. Check if the map renders correctly with appropriate initial zoom level and center coordinates. Score 0 if no map is displayed, 5 if basic map display works but with initialization issues, and 10 if the map initializes perfectly with proper error handling.",

Check if markers persist after placement and if their positions are accurately maintained when zooming or panning. Deduct 5 points if marker placement works but lacks user interaction feedback, 3 points if markers don't maintain accurate positions, and 5 points if no custom styling options are available.

Verify that multiple file formats are supported (at least JPG, PNG, GIF) and that proper validation occurs for file size and type. Deduct 5 points if only one upload method is available, 3 points if file validation is missing, and 5 points if large photos aren't resized/compressed for performance. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for preview thumbnails, full-size viewing options, and if multiple photos per marker are supported. Deduct 5 points if the photo-marker visual association is unclear, 3 points if there's no larger view option for photos, and 5 points if multiple photos per marker aren't supported.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to map/photo features (e.g., unnecessary social sharing widgets) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when showing photos). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
