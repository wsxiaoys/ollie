      "description": "Evaluate whether the code correctly implements the structure of a chick character using HTML and CSS. Check if proper divs/elements are used for the body, head, wings, feet, and face features. The chick should be clearly recognizable with appropriate proportions. Score 0 if the chick is not implemented, 5 if basic structure exists but lacks detail, and 10 if it's fully detailed with proper nesting and organization of elements.",

      "title": "Are the overalls accurately depicted on the chick character?",
      "description": "Assess whether the code properly implements overalls on the chick, including straps, pockets, and the distinctive overall shape. Check if proper styling techniques (gradients, shadows, borders) are used to create a 3D effect. Deduct 5 points if the overalls lack key details, 3 points if the connection to the chick's body is unrealistic. Give full 10 points only if the overalls are visually distinguishable with proper fit to the chick's body.",

      "title": "Is the basketball interaction/animation properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review the implementation of the basketball and the chick's interaction with it. Check if the basketball has proper styling (texture, shading) and if there's an animation showing the chick playing with it (dribbling, shooting, or holding). Score 0 if no basketball interaction exists, 5 if static basketball is present, and 10 if dynamic, realistic basketball play animation is implemented with proper physics.",

      "title": "Is the scene/background context appropriate for basketball play?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes a suitable background/environment for playing basketball (court markings, hoop, etc.). Check if the scene elements are proportional to the chick character and if there's depth perception in the implementation. Deduct 5 points if the background is incomplete, 3 points if perspective is incorrect. Full score requires a complete basketball context with proper scaling and positioning.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle different screen sizes (responsive design), browser compatibility, and load efficiently. Check for proper fallbacks, error handling for animations, and adaptive layouts. Code with strong robustness should work across major browsers and device sizes, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no adaptability is handled, give 0 points.",

Multiple animation sequences triggered by user interaction). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant styling with overlapping CSS rules 2. Unnecessary elements unrelated to the chick or basketball scene 3. Heavy animations or effects that affect performance without adding value. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core elements (chick, overalls, basketball) are obscured by redundant elements.",

Deduct 5 points if global styling pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is high (similar styling repeated); deduct 5 points if no performance optimizations are implemented (like CSS animations instead of JavaScript where appropriate). The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the design follows modern design principles: 1) Harmonious color scheme appropriate for a playful character scene 2) Proper layout with good use of whitespace 3) Consistent styling throughout elements. Deduct 3 points for each poorly aligned element, 5 points for clashing colors, and 5 points for inconsistent styling between scene elements. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for jerky animations, 3 points for unrealistic physics, and 5 points for animations that don't match a chick's natural movements. The full score is 10 points.",
