      "title": "Is the tree growing animation fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a tree growth animation through HTML/CSS/JavaScript, showing progression from seed/sapling to full tree. Check for clear visual stages of growth, proper timing, and smooth transitions between stages. Score 0 if no animation exists, 5 if only basic static-to-static transitions are implemented, and 10 if the animation shows organic, natural growth patterns.",

      "title": "Is the tree structure anatomically realistic?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the tree implementation includes proper botanical elements (trunk, branches, leaves, possibly roots) with natural branching patterns. Check if the branching algorithm follows realistic principles like L-systems or fractal patterns. Deduct 5 points if the tree structure is overly simplistic (just a trunk and few branches), and 3 points if the branching angles are unnaturally uniform. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Are environmental factors incorporated into the tree growth?",
      "description": "Assess whether the code integrates environmental elements that affect the tree's growth (e.g., simulated sunlight, seasons, weather conditions, or user interaction). Check if these factors visibly influence the tree's development direction, speed, or appearance. Deduct 5 points if no environmental factors exist, and 3 points if factors exist but have minimal visual impact on growth. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Is the rendering technique appropriate and efficient?",
      "description": "Examine the technical approach used for rendering the tree (Canvas, SVG, CSS, WebGL, etc.) and whether it's appropriate for the complexity of the animation. Check for performance optimization like limiting redraws to changed elements only. Deduct 5 points for excessive DOM manipulation causing jank, 5 points if the technique chosen severely limits visual quality, and 3 points if no performance considerations are evident. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as window resizing, browser compatibility issues, different screen sizes, etc.) and provides appropriate fallbacks. Code with strong robustness should gracefully degrade on older browsers and respond appropriately to viewport changes, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no edge cases are handled, give 0 points.",

Day/night cycle affecting the tree 3. Wildlife/insects appearing around the tree 4. Seasonal changes with appropriate visuals). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple animation systems working simultaneously) 2. Function modules unrelated to tree growth (e.g., unnecessary UI elements) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems that slow down the page). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

      "description": "Review modular design (such as separating rendering logic/animation/user interaction), code organization, and maintainability. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation of concerns.

Deduct 3 points for unrealistic coloring, 5 points for poor composition that distracts from the tree, and 5 points for low-quality visual assets. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Judge whether the growth animation conforms to natural growth patterns: 1) Smooth interpolation between growth stages 2) Appropriate timing that balances between visible growth and realism 3) Natural movement like subtle swaying or response to simulated wind. Deduct 5 points for jerky transitions, 3 points for unnaturally linear growth rates, and 5 points for static elements that should move naturally. The full score is 10 points.",
