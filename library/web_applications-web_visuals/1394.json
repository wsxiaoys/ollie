Score 0 if no transformation is implemented, 5 if there's basic transformation but lacks depth perception, and 10 if the transformation includes proper perspective, shading, and visual depth cues.",

Look for proper context management, efficient redrawing strategy, and correct handling of canvas dimensions. Deduct 5 points if using inefficient redraw methods (like clearing the entire canvas unnecessarily), 3 points if canvas dimensions are not responsive, and 3 points if transformations cause visual artifacts.
