Check if icons are properly loaded and rendered using the Font Awesome library. Score 0 if icons are not displayed at all, 5 if only basic display is implemented, and 10 if a complete, categorized display is implemented with proper naming convention for each icon.",

Check if the search is responsive (updates results as the user types) and has error handling for no results. Deduct 5 points if search is missing, 3 points if it's basic without real-time filtering, and 2 points if it lacks visual feedback when no results are found. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if there's no interaction with icons, 3 points if only basic hover effects exist, and 2 points if copy functionality is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Feature modules unrelated to icon preview (e.g., a built-in calendar) 3. Heavy visual effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when scrolling through icons). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance optimizations exist for rendering hundreds of icons.

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a color scheme that makes icons hard to distinguish, and 5 points for inconsistent spacing between icon elements.

Deduct 5 points for noticeable lag when loading large icon sets, 3 points for jarring transitions between views, and 5 points for poor mobile responsiveness. The full score is 10 points.",
