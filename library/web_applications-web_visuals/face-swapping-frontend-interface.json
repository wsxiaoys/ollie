  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable.\n\nThis is a Python face-swapping project I found on GitHub. Here's the file structure, and now I'd like you to help me create a frontend interface where I can upload the face image I want to swap and the target face image, then click a generate button to perform the face swap and display the successfully swapped face image in the frontend interface. Below is the Python code from the run.py file:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom roop import core\nfrom inference_codeformer import inference_codeformer\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    newface = r\"inputs/1.jpg\"  # New face image\n    oldface = r\"inputs/4.jpg\"  # Old face image\n    savepath = r\"outputs/output_009.png\"\n\n    core.run(newface, oldface, savepath)\n    inference_codeformer.run(savepath)",

      "description": "Check whether the frontend interface correctly implements the core functionality to upload two face images (source and target) and trigger the face-swapping process. The interface should include clear upload areas for both images with proper labeling and a generate button. Score 0 if uploads aren't implemented, 5 if only basic uploads work without proper validation, and 10 if the interface handles the complete workflow with clear visual guidance.",

This includes handling API calls, processing responses, and managing errors. Check if the implementation uses appropriate techniques like AJAX, fetch API, or WebSockets.

The previews should be properly sized, maintain aspect ratios, and be clearly labeled. Deduct 5 points if only the result is shown without previews of source images, and 3 points if previews exist but have rendering issues. Full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to face-swapping (e.g., unnecessary social media integration) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations that slow down the interface).
