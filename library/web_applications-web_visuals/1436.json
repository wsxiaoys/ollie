      "description": "Verify whether the code includes a correctly configured HTML5 canvas element with appropriate dimensions, responsive design considerations, and proper initialization. Check if the canvas context (2D or WebGL) is properly obtained and utilized. Score 0 if canvas is missing, 5 if basic implementation exists, and 10 if it includes advanced features like resolution scaling and browser compatibility solutions.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of dynamic drawing techniques such as animation loops (requestAnimationFrame), procedural generation, or interactive elements. Check for smooth frame rates (60fps target), efficient redrawing strategies, and proper timing mechanisms. Deduct 5 points if animations are jerky, 3 points if there's no frame rate control, and 5 points if there are no dynamic elements at all.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code implements meaningful user interactions such as mouse/touch events, keyboard controls, or gesture recognition that allow users to engage with the artwork. Check for event delegation, proper event listener cleanup, and accessible interaction patterns. Deduct 5 points for missing interaction, 3 points for poor event handling, and 5 points for inaccessible controls.",

Look for color pickers, sliders for visual parameters, or theme options. Score 0 if no customization exists, 5 points for basic controls, and 10 for comprehensive artistic customization options.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code handles common edge cases (such as browser inconsistencies, window resizing, device orientation changes, etc.) and provides graceful fallbacks or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should handle these edge cases effectively, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

AR/VR capabilities). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Overly complex animations that harm performance without adding artistic value. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core artwork display is interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global namespace pollution is found; deduct 5 points if there's excessive code duplication; deduct 5 points if no performance considerations (like debouncing/throttling for intensive operations) exist.

Deduct 5 points for laggy responses, 3 points for jarring transitions, and 5 points for animations that distract from appreciating the artwork. The full score is 10 points.",
