Verify if the Unity iframe or container div is structured correctly with appropriate dimensions and responsive design considerations. Deduct 5 points if responsive design is missing, 3 points if incomplete meta tags, and 2 points if semantic HTML elements are not used. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper URL handling, loading states, and error handling when the Unity content is unavailable. Deduct 5 points if the embedding approach is incorrect, 3 points if loading indicators are missing, and 2 points if error states aren't handled. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the implementation uses standard Unity external call patterns (e.g., SendMessage, JSLib) and properly handles asynchronous messaging. Deduct 5 points if bidirectional communication is missing, 3 points if event listeners are improperly implemented, and 2 points if security considerations are ignored. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the controls follow a consistent design pattern and provide visual feedback when interacting with Unity.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Unity integration (e.g., unnecessary animations or effects) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy background animations competing with Unity rendering).
