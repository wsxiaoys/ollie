      "description": "Review whether the code properly initializes the Amap instance with appropriate API keys, correctly loads the required plugins, and handles map lifecycle events. Check if the map container is properly configured with correct dimensions and initial view settings (center coordinates, zoom level). Score 0 if the map fails to initialize, 5 if basic initialization works but missing error handling, and 10 if fully implemented with proper error handling and loading states.",

Check if the buildings have proper height extrusion, accurate geographic positioning, and appropriate texturing.

Verify tile loading optimization techniques like caching and level-of-detail management.

Code with strong robustness should implement proper try-catch blocks around API calls, handle promise rejections, and provide fallback rendering.
