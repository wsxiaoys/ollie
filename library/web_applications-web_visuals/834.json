Check for proper component architecture, reactive data handling with Composition API, and lifecycle management when rendering the map. Score 0 if no integration exists, 5 if basic integration exists but with errors, and 10 if the integration is flawlessly implemented with proper Vue3 paradigms.",

Code with strong robustness should provide appropriate error boundaries, fallback UI states, and defensive programming techniques.
