      "title": "Is the floating text functionality properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code uses jQuery to create elements that float across the screen with smooth animation. Check if the text moves in different directions, speeds, or patterns. Score 0 if no animation exists, 5 if only basic linear movement is implemented, and 10 if there are multiple floating patterns (e.g., sine wave, circular, bounce) with configurable parameters.",

      "title": "Is the text generation and management system complete?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes mechanisms to generate texts dynamically, manage their lifecycle (creation, animation, removal), and handle text overlap. Deduct 3 points if text elements pile up without being removed after leaving the viewport. Deduct 4 points if there's no system to prevent excessive DOM elements. Score 10 if the implementation includes efficient object pooling or equivalent performance optimizations.",

      "description": "Check whether users can interact with floating text (e.g., click to remove, hover to pause, drag to reposition). Deduct 5 points if no interaction is implemented. Score full 10 points if multiple intuitive interaction methods are available with appropriate visual feedback (e.g., color change on hover, subtle animation on click).",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid user interactions, browser resize, mobile device orientation changes) and provide graceful degradation. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Complex animations that could be simplified with CSS transitions/animations. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points for excessive direct DOM manipulations; deduct 5 points if jQuery selectors are inefficient; deduct 5 points if event handlers aren't properly cleaned up.

Deduct 3 points for poor color combinations affecting readability, 5 points for inconsistent text styling, and 5 points for cluttered visual presentation. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for noticeable jank during animation, 3 points for excessive reflows/repaints, and 5 points for significant performance degradation with multiple texts. The full score is 10 points.",
