Develop a video transition effects editor where users can upload two video clips and choose from three common transition effects (such as cross-fade, push-pull transition, flip transition) to merge them into a complete video.",

      "description": "Review whether the code provides a complete solution for uploading, validating, and managing two video clips. Check for proper file validation (format checking, size limits), progress indicators during upload, and appropriate error handling. Score 0 if video upload functionality is missing, 5 if basic upload exists but lacks validation or error handling, and 10 if comprehensive upload management with proper feedback is implemented.",

Each effect should have customizable parameters (duration, direction if applicable) and accurate preview capability. Deduct 3 points for each missing effect.

The preview should accurately represent the final output, showing the actual transition at the correct timing. Deduct 5 points if preview is significantly delayed or inaccurate.

Function modules unrelated to video editing (e.g., a built-in social media platform) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations in the UI).
