  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Using JS, write a complete webpage that uses face-api.js to automatically enhance people in camera video, including face slimming, skin whitening, eye enlargement, makeup changing, outfit changing and other features. Display a final output video window that is complete, aesthetically pleasing, perfect, smooth, and seamless. Use the latest technology with complete usable source code. Pay attention to details, make the interface beautiful with a sci-fi style, at a product-grade level.",

      "description": "Verify if the code correctly integrates face-api.js for robust face detection and tracking. Check if it loads the required models (SSD MobileNet, facial landmarks, etc.), handles multiple faces, and maintains tracking between frames. Score 0 if basic face detection is missing, 5 if only basic detection works, and 10 if detection includes accurate landmark tracking with proper error handling for lighting variations and partial face visibility.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements all requested beauty features (face slimming, skin whitening, eye enlargement, makeup changing, outfit changing). Check if each effect uses appropriate algorithms: face slimming should use mesh warping with landmark controls; skin whitening needs color correction with tone preservation; eye enlargement should use proportional landmark manipulation; makeup should utilize layer blending with alpha masks; outfit changing requires body segmentation and virtual try-on. Deduct 2 points for each missing feature or 1 point if poorly implemented. Full score requires all features with smooth transitions between them.",

Check for: worker thread utilization for computation-heavy tasks, WebGL/GPU acceleration for filters, downsampling during heavy processing, keyframe interval optimization, and proper memory management to prevent leaks. Score 10 if processing runs at 30+ FPS on mid-range hardware with negligible latency, 5 if noticeable but usable lag exists, and 0 if processing causes severe frame drops or browser crashes.",

Each effect should have at least a basic intensity slider, and advanced options where appropriate. Score 10 if controls include: real-time preview, presets, individual feature toggles, intensity sliders with numerical values, and ability to save custom settings.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to beauty enhancement (e.g., unrelated animations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects that slow down processing).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if resources are not properly managed (memory leaks, no cleanup on page unload).
