      "description": "Review whether the code creates a recognizable 3D model or 2D representation of Xu Zhisheng with proper facial features, proportions, and expressions that match his appearance. Score 0 if the character is generic without resemblance, 5 if it has basic similar features but lacks detail, and 10 if the model accurately captures his distinctive look and persona.",

Deduct 3 points if stage lighting effects are missing, 3 points if the stage layout is unrealistic, and 2 points if audience elements are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if animations are static or missing, 5 if only basic movements are implemented, and 10 if the animations convincingly capture the dynamic nature of stand-up comedy performance with varied gestures and expressions.",

Deduct 5 points if the AI approach is superficially mentioned without actual implementation, 3 points if inappropriate AI methods are used for character animation. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the comedy performance (e.g., unnecessary game mechanics) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle effects).
