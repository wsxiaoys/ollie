Be careful to ensure that the code you generate can be executed and displayed. Create an online video puzzle generator where users can select multiple images, set the order and duration of each image in the video, add transition effects, choose background music, and export as a video file. Provide a real-time preview feature.",

      "description": "Review whether the code allows users to select multiple images from their device, add them to a working area, reorder them, and manage them (delete, duplicate). Check if there's proper validation for file formats (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.) and size limitations. Score 0 if no image selection is implemented, 5 if basic selection exists but lacks management features, and 10 if complete with drag-and-drop reordering and thumbnail previews.",

Check if time markers and timeline scrubbing are implemented. Deduct 5 points if only basic duration input fields exist without visual timeline representation, and 3 points if timeline navigation lacks scrubbing functionality. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the code provides a variety of transition effects (fade, slide, zoom, etc.) between images with real-time previews. Each transition should be customizable in terms of duration and parameters. Evaluate if transitions render smoothly in the preview. Deduct 5 points if fewer than 5 transition types are available, and 3 points if transitions appear choppy in preview. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for audio visualization during preview. Deduct 5 points if audio trimming isn't supported, and 3 points if volume control is missing.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to video puzzle creation (e.g., a built-in social sharing system) 3. Resource-intensive effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary real-time video processing during editing).
