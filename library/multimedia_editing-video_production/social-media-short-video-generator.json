Implement a social media short video generator where users can upload image and video materials, and the system provides various video templates (such as stories, product showcases, travel logs, etc.). Users can replace materials in templates, adjust duration, add text and stickers. Support adding background music and adjusting volume, and export the finished product in different sizes and formats suitable for Instagram, TikTok and WeChat.",

Check for file type validation, size limits, progress indicators, and thumbnail generation. Score 0 if upload functionality is missing, 5 if basic upload exists but lacks proper validation or processing, 10 if the system includes comprehensive asset management with tagging, categorization, and search capabilities.",
