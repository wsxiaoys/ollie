Implement a frontend tool for adding animated elements to videos, where users can upload videos, select different animated elements (such as twinkling stars, scrolling text, etc.) to add to the video, set the appearance time and duration of these animated elements, preview the effect, and then export the video.",

Verify if the uploaded video can be properly loaded into the editor canvas. Score 0 if upload functionality is missing, 5 if basic upload exists but lacks validation or proper error handling, and 10 if fully implemented with comprehensive validation and user feedback.",

Check if each element has proper customization options (size, color, opacity, animation speed). Deduct 2 points for each major animation type missing, deduct 3 points if the animations are not smooth or have rendering issues.

Check for the presence of a visual timeline interface, keyframe markers, ability to adjust duration, and precise timing controls. Deduct 5 points if only basic start/end time inputs are available without visual timeline, deduct 3 points if keyframe editing is clunky or imprecise.

Verify if the export function properly renders the final video with all added elements at the correct positions and times. Deduct 5 points if preview is severely lagging or inconsistent with the final export, deduct 8 points if export functionality is missing, deduct 3 points if export options (resolution, format) are limited.

Look for error boundaries, graceful degradation, and informative error messages. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these scenarios, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no error handling is implemented, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to video editing (e.g., a built-in image gallery unrelated to the animations) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary UI animations that slow down the editor).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no optimization for video processing performance.
