Create a subtitle generation tool where users can upload videos and add corresponding subtitle text based on provided timestamps. Support customization of font, color, and size. Subtitles should display synchronously during video playback and can be exported together with the video.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements video file upload with proper format validation (MP4, WebM, AVI, etc.), file size restrictions, and progress indicators. Check if video metadata extraction (duration, resolution, frame rate) is correctly implemented and displayed. Score 0 if basic upload is not working, 5 if only simple upload without validation is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive upload with metadata processing and error handling is fully included.",

Evaluate if the code handles subtitle display/hide transitions smoothly and supports common subtitle formats (SRT, VTT). Deduct 5 points if synchronization drift exceeds 100ms, and 3 points if subtitle overlap handling is missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if text styling options include bold, italic, outline, and shadow effects.

Evaluate if the export process includes progress tracking, quality options, and batch processing capabilities. Deduct 5 points if subtitles are only overlaid without proper encoding, and 3 points if export progress feedback is missing. Give 10 points if fully implemented with multiple format support.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to subtitle generation (e.g., built-in video editing tools) 3. Heavy processing that affects performance (e.g., unnecessary real-time video filters).
