Develop a browser-based real-time video recording and editing tool that allows users to record video through their camera, perform basic editing (cutting, merging), add text and filters, preview editing effects in real-time, and export the recorded video.",

      "description": "Check if the code correctly implements the MediaStream API to access the user's camera, creates a robust MediaRecorder implementation for video capture, and handles permission requests gracefully. Score 0 if there's no video recording functionality, 5 if basic recording works but lacks error handling, and 10 if it includes proper permission handling, recording indicators, and fallback mechanisms for unsupported browsers.",

Check if it can accurately cut video at specified timestamps and merge multiple clips together. Deduct 5 points if the editing causes quality loss, 3 points if the editing operations aren't precise to the frame level, and 3 points if preview generation of edits is slow (>500ms).

Assess if text can be styled, positioned, and timed properly, and if filters are applied efficiently without significant performance degradation. Deduct 3 points if text positioning is imprecise, 3 points if filter previews aren't real-time, and 4 points if there's no keyframe support for text/filter timing. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the preview accurately represents the final output and updates dynamically as users make changes. Deduct 5 points if the preview isn't representative of the final export, 5 points if there's noticeable lag (>250ms) when applying complex effects, and 3 points if the preview doesn't update automatically with edits.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to video editing (e.g., a built-in file manager) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive background animations).
