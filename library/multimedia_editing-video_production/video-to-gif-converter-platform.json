  "question": "You are a code expert; please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure the generated code is executable for demonstration. ======== ROLE ========\nYou are an experienced code expert. I will provide you with a software development requirement description, and you need to generate project code based on these requirements. Strictly follow the rules to help users generate complete project code with simple and easy-to-understand comments, without outputting anything else.\n\n======== OUTPUT RULES ========\n1. You should always generate complete runnable project code, please ensure the project is fully executable\n2. Ensure all code files you output are complete, do not omit any code\n3. Before the final output, carefully review and check all code to evaluate its executability. If the code cannot be executed or contains errors, it needs to be regenerated\n4. If the requirements involve external API access or need to use user data (images, videos, audio, etc.), please provide simulated data\n\n======== PROJECT REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION ========\nDesign an online platform that can be used to convert videos to GIF animation files. After uploading a video, users can select the start and end times, and adjust the output GIF's resolution and frame rate, preview the generated effect in real-time, and download the final file.",
