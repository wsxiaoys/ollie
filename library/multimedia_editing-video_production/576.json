  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate, professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the code you generate is executable and can be demonstrated. Please create a transition effect editor that allows users to add various transition effects to different clips in a video, such as fade-in/fade-out, slide, dissolve, etc. Users should be able to preview each transition effect, adjust its duration, and ultimately generate a video with the transition effects.",

      "description": "Review whether the code creates a comprehensive UI with elements for video upload, clip management, transition selection, timeline visualization, and preview functionality. Score 0 if the core interface elements are missing, 5 if basic elements are present but not fully functional, and 10 if the interface includes drag-and-drop capabilities, clear visual indicators for transitions, and intuitive controls for adjusting transition parameters.",

      "description": "Check if the code implements at least the following transitions with proper parameterization: fade-in/fade-out, dissolve, wipe (multiple directions), slide (multiple directions), zoom, and rotation. Each effect should have customizable duration and easing functions. Deduct 2 points for each missing core transition effect. Give full points only if the transitions are implemented with proper rendering techniques (e.g., using WebGL for hardware acceleration when appropriate).",

      "description": "Evaluate whether users can preview the entire video with transitions or individual transitions in isolation. The preview should accurately represent how the final video will look. Check if the preview supports: play/pause, seeking to specific points, real-time application of transition changes, and correct timing. Deduct 3 points if preview performance is noticeably slow, 5 points if transitions don't render accurately in preview, and 2 points if seeking/timeline navigation is not implemented.",

This should include proper video encoding (like H.264), maintaining original video quality, progress indicators during rendering, and options for output format and quality. Deduct 5 points if rendering is client-side only without server option for heavy processing, 3 points if video quality is significantly degraded, and 5 points if there's no export functionality at all.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to video editing (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive UI animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
