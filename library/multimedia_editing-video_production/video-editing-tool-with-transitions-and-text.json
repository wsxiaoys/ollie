  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate, professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration. Please write code to implement a video editing tool where users can upload multiple video clips, crop each clip, and adjust the order through drag and drop. The tool needs to support adding transition effects (fade-in/fade-out, cross-dissolve, wipe, etc. - at least 5 different effects), allow users to add text annotations and simple animation effects to videos. After completing the edits, users can preview the composite result and export it as MP4 format.",

The implementation should provide visual indicators for start/end points, preview thumbnails at different timestamps, and maintain video quality during trimming operations. Deduct 5 points if the trimming lacks frame-level precision, 3 points if there's no visual timeline for selection, and 3 points if the preview mechanism is absent. The full score is 10 points.",
