      "description": "Review whether the code successfully creates a video output with proper love confession elements. Check if the code includes video creation libraries (e.g., ffmpeg wrappers), animation frameworks, or canvas-to-video conversion. Score 0 if no video output is possible, 5 if basic video is created but with limitations, 10 if a complete video with smooth playback is implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of animations, transitions, or interactive elements in the confession. Look for CSS animations, JavaScript animations (GSAP, anime.js), or canvas-based animations. Deduct 5 points if animations are jerky or have performance issues, 3 points if timing is poorly synchronized. The full score is 10 points for smooth, thematic animations that enhance the confession.",

Score 10 points if the code includes clear variables or parameters for customization, 5 points if limited customization is possible but requires code editing, 0 points if all content is hardcoded without any customization options.",

Check for proper audio format support, volume control, and synchronization with visual elements. Deduct 5 points if audio implementation is present but not synchronized with visuals, 3 points if audio controls are missing. The full score is 10 points for complete audio implementation with proper timing.",

Code with strong robustness should handle edge cases effectively, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Particle effects or visual surprises 3. Responsive design that adapts to different viewing contexts). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to the confession (e.g., unnecessary game elements) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global scope pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear organization or commenting.

Deduct 3 points for each visual design flaw, 5 points for clashing colors or illegible text, and 5 points for chaotic layout. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for an overly generic approach, 3 points for mismatched tone or mood, and 5 points for elements that detract from the sincere message. The full score is 10 points.",
