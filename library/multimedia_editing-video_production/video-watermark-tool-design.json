  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable whenever possible. Design a video watermark tool that allows users to upload a video, drag and drop to select a watermark image, position the watermark on the video, set its display time, and finally generate and export the watermarked video.",

      "description": "Review whether the code supports multiple video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, WebM) with proper format validation and file size limits. Check if video metadata extraction (duration, resolution, frame rate) is implemented correctly. Evaluate progress tracking during upload and proper error handling for corrupted files. Score 0 if basic upload is missing, 5 if only single format supported with basic validation, and 10 if comprehensive multi-format support with robust error handling is implemented.",

Evaluate if the system includes snap-to-grid functionality, boundary constraints, and precise pixel-level positioning. Review if watermark scaling and rotation controls are implemented with proper aspect ratio maintenance. Deduct 5 points if drag boundaries are not enforced, 3 points if visual feedback is laggy (>50ms delay). Full score requires smooth real-time preview with sub-pixel accuracy.",

Check if the system supports multiple watermark layers with independent timing controls and z-index management. Review fade-in/fade-out effects implementation and keyframe-based animation support. Deduct 5 points if timing granularity exceeds 100ms, 3 points if timeline scrubbing is not smooth. Full score requires professional-grade timeline control with multi-layer support.",

Evaluate output quality options (resolution, bitrate, codec selection) and progress tracking during export. Review whether the system maintains original video quality while properly compositing watermarks. Deduct 5 points if export time exceeds 3x video duration for standard processing, 5 points if output quality degradation is noticeable. Full score requires optimized rendering with quality preservation.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to video watermarking (e.g., built-in video editing suite) 3. Fancy effects that affect processing performance (e.g., excessive real-time filters during preview).

Deduct 5 points if memory leaks are found or Web Workers are not used for heavy processing; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no progress indicators are implemented for long operations.
