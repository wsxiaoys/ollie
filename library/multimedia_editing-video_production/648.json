      "description": "Check if the code includes proper file input handling for video uploads, with support for common video formats (MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV). The implementation should validate file types, manage upload size limits (showing progress for large files), and handle upload errors gracefully with user feedback. Score 0 if no upload functionality exists, 5 if basic upload works but lacks validation, 10 if fully implemented with comprehensive error handling.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code properly implements resolution adjustment to exactly 720p (1280x720) and 480p (854x480) while maintaining aspect ratio. The implementation should use efficient video processing libraries (like FFmpeg wrappers or Web API solutions) and properly handle codec compatibility. Deduct 3 points if aspect ratio is not preserved, 5 points if resolution options are hardcoded without flexibility, and 5 points if the conversion process doesn't provide status updates.

Check if the implementation includes download progress indicators and handles large file downloads appropriately (using Blob or stream processing).

The preview should include basic playback controls (play/pause, seek, volume) and display resolution information. Deduct 5 points if the preview doesn't work across different browsers, and 3 points if the video controls are minimal or buggy. Give 10 points if the preview includes side-by-side comparison with visual quality indicators.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to video resolution adjustment (e.g., excessive video editing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations or filters).
