  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable whenever possible. Develop a Picture-in-Picture video effect editor that allows users to upload one main video and multiple auxiliary videos, displaying the auxiliary videos as picture-in-picture on the main video. Users can adjust the size, position, border, and shape (such as circle, oval, etc.) of the picture-in-picture, and set entrance and exit animation effects. Support simultaneous display of multiple picture-in-picture elements with timeline control, suitable for creating reaction videos, commentary videos, and educational demonstrations.",

      "description": "Check if the code allows users to upload one main video and multiple auxiliary videos with proper file validation (checking formats like MP4, WebM, AVI, etc.) and error handling. The system should manage these videos efficiently with preview functionality before adding them to the editor. Score 0 if video upload is not implemented, 5 if only basic uploads work without validation, and 10 if complete video management with previews and format validation is implemented.",

Deduct 3 points if position control is limited to predefined spots, 3 points if resizing doesn't maintain aspect ratio, and 4 points if z-index management is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for entrance/exit animation capabilities (fade, slide, zoom, etc.) with customizable duration and easing functions. Deduct 5 points if timeline scrubbing precision is poor, 3 points if animation options are limited to fewer than 5 types, and 2 points if animation easing controls are missing.

Function modules unrelated to video editing (e.g., a built-in social network) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive background animations).
