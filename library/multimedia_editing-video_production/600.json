  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you produce is executable whenever possible. Please implement a video Picture-in-Picture creation tool that allows users to upload two video clips, where one is reduced in size and floats at any position over the other video during playback. Users should be able to customize the size and position of the child video, and export the edited video.",

Check if the code includes progress indicators during upload. Score 0 if uploading is not implemented, 5 if basic uploading exists but lacks validation, 10 if complete with all error handling.",
