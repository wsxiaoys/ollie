      "description": "Check if the code provides a complete video upload solution including file selection, validation, progress indication and error handling. The implementation should handle various video formats (MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI) and validate file size. Score 0 if upload functionality is missing, 5 if only basic upload is implemented without validation, and 10 if it includes comprehensive validation, progress tracking and error handling.",

It should support text watermarks (with customizable font, size, color, opacity) and image watermarks (with position control, scaling and opacity adjustment). Check if the watermark preview is available before processing. Deduct 5 points if only one type of watermark is supported, and 3 points if customization options are limited.

      "description": "Assess the video processing implementation. The code should use efficient methods like HTML5 Canvas, WebAssembly or Web Workers to handle video frames without freezing the UI. Check if it supports batch processing and provides processing status feedback. Deduct 5 points if processing is done entirely on the main thread causing UI blocks, 3 points if there's no optimization for large files. The full score is 10 points.",

The preview should be responsive and the download should retain original video quality while including the watermark. The code should support different output formats and quality settings.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Watermark templates gallery 4. Batch processing with different watermarks). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to watermarking (e.g., a built-in social sharing system) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations during processing). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if memory leaks could occur during video processing.

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for jarring transitions between processing steps, and 5 points for confusing workflow that doesn't guide users through the watermarking process.
