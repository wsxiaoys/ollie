Please implement a multi-track video editor that allows users to add video, audio, and subtitles on different tracks. Users should be able to independently control the order, volume, and visibility of each track, and finally export all tracks as a single composite video file.",

Score 0 if the timeline interface is not implemented, 5 if it's basic without zooming or customization, and 10 if it includes features like time markers, snap-to-grid, and customizable track heights.",

Deduct 3 points if any track type is missing, 3 points if track-specific controls are incomplete, and 2 points if the visualization is inadequate. The full score is 10 points.",

The implementation should include progress tracking and error handling.

Function modules unrelated to video editing (e.g., built-in social media sharing) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessarily complex animations in the UI).
