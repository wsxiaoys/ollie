      "description": "Evaluate whether the code creates a functional HTML5 video player that includes standard controls (play/pause, volume, fullscreen) and implements a custom timeline with proper event handling. The player should support common video formats (MP4, WebM) and handle video loading errors gracefully. Score 0 if no functional video player exists, 5 if only basic playback works, and 10 for a complete implementation with error handling.",

Notes should be editable and thumbnails should accurately represent the video frame at the bookmark timestamp.

Function modules unrelated to video marking (e.g., unnecessary social sharing features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the interface).
