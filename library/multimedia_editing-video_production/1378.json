The animation should maintain Arsenal's brand identity throughout. Deduct 5 points if incorrect colors are used, 3 points if the logo is distorted or missing, and 2 points if typography doesn't match Arsenal's official fonts. The full score is 10 points.",

Player names and numbers should be accurate. Score 10 points for detailed, professional player representations; 5 points if players are generic or outdated; 0 points if players are unrecognizable or missing entirely.",

Deduct 3 points for jerky transitions, 4 points for frame rate drops below 30fps, and 3 points if the animation lacks proper sequencing. The full score is 10 points.",

The narrative should have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Score 10 points for a complete narrative with logical flow; 5 points for basic narrative elements without cohesion; 0 points if the animation lacks any storytelling elements.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Heavy effects that severely impact performance without adding value. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core promotional message is obscured by redundant elements.",
