      "description": "Evaluate whether the code properly implements the watermark removal algorithm through video processing techniques. Check if it can extract the original video URL from TikTok shared links, download the video, and process it to remove watermarks. Score 0 if no watermark removal logic is present, 5 if basic URL extraction is implemented but processing is incomplete, and 10 if the complete pipeline (link parsing, video downloading, watermark removal) is functional.",

The mini-program should work on WeChat, Alipay, and other platforms. Examine if conditional compilation is used for platform-specific code. Deduct 5 points if platform adaptation is missing, 3 points if uni-app lifecycle hooks are improperly implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Function modules unrelated to watermark removal (e.g., built-in games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations).
