  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate, professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration. Develop a frontend video feature for adding animated stickers. After users upload videos, they can select different animated stickers (such as dynamic emoticons, cartoon patterns, etc.) to add to the video, set the position and timing of the stickers, preview the video with stickers in real-time, and export the video when complete.",

      "title": "Is the video upload and processing system fully implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code provides complete video upload functionality with proper file type validation, size limits, progress indicators, and error handling. Check if the uploaded video is properly processed for manipulation (decoding, frame extraction if needed). Score 0 if video upload is not implemented, 5 if basic upload exists but lacks validation or error handling, and 10 if it includes comprehensive upload features with proper feedback mechanisms.",

Check if stickers are properly categorized, searchable, and if there's support for user-uploaded custom stickers. Score 0 if sticker selection is missing, 5 if basic sticker selection exists without organization or preview features, and 10 if it includes a well-designed sticker library with preview capabilities and custom sticker upload support.",

      "description": "Check if the code allows users to drag-and-drop stickers onto the video, resize them, rotate them, and set their appearance/disappearance timing. Verify if there's a timeline control for precise timing adjustment. Deduct 3 points if position editing is limited, 4 points if timing controls are missing, and 5 points if the interface lacks real-time feedback during adjustment. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the preview updates immediately when sticker positions or timing are changed. Verify if the preview maintains proper synchronization between video and stickers. Score 0 if preview is not available, 5 if basic preview exists but with performance issues or synchronization problems, and 10 if the preview is smooth, accurate, and responsive to all user edits.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to video sticker editing (e.g., a built-in social network) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary background animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.
