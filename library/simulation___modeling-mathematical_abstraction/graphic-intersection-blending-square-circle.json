      "description": "Review whether the code accurately defines and renders both the square and circle with proper parameters (coordinates, dimensions, radius). The square should have consistent side lengths, and the circle should be mathematically accurate. Score 0 if shapes are incorrectly implemented, 5 if basic shapes are drawn but with minor inaccuracies, and 10 if both shapes are perfectly implemented with proper mathematical properties.",

The intersection should be precisely determined with appropriate geometric calculations (distance checks, boundary evaluations). Deduct 5 points if the algorithm only approximates the intersection, 3 points if edge cases aren't handled (e.g., tangent points, complete overlap). The full score is 10 points.",

The overlapping area should be clearly distinguishable from the non-overlapping parts with appropriate visual treatment (different color, opacity, or pattern).

Check for event listeners that enable drag-and-drop functionality or parameter adjustments.
