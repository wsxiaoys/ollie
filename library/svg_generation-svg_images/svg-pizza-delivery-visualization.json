Make sure the code you generate is executable for demonstration purposes. Please help me implement the following requirement using SVG code: create a pizza delivery visualization.",

      "title": "Is the basic pizza visualization properly implemented?",
      "description": "Check if the SVG code accurately renders a recognizable pizza with appropriate elements (crust, cheese, toppings). The pizza should have proper proportions and realistic appearance. Score 0 if no pizza is visible, 5 if basic shape is implemented but lacks detail, and 10 if the pizza looks realistic with proper textures and gradients.",

    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Is the delivery animation/movement implemented?",
      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of movement showing the pizza delivery process. Check for smooth animation paths (using SVG animation elements or JavaScript), proper timing functions, and realistic movement physics. Deduct 5 points if the animation is jerky, 3 points if the timing is unnatural, and 5 points if there's no actual delivery movement visualization. The full score is 10 points.",
      "maxScore": 10
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Is the delivery context/environment visualized?",
      "description": "Assess whether the visualization includes contextual elements like a delivery vehicle (car/scooter/bike), a map/route, delivery person, or restaurant/customer locations. Score 0 if there's no context at all, 5 if minimal context is provided (e.g., just a map), and 10 if there's a complete environment with multiple context elements that enhance the delivery story.",
      "maxScore": 10
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "title": "Is there interactive functionality for the visualization?",
      "description": "Check if the SVG implementation includes user interaction capabilities like clicking to start/pause delivery, hovering for additional information, zooming/panning the delivery route, or customizing the pizza. Score 0 if no interaction exists, 5 if basic interactions are implemented, and 10 if there are multiple meaningful interactions that enhance the visualization's purpose.",

      "id": 4,
      "title": "Is the code robust?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as browser resizing, unsupported SVG features in older browsers, user interaction errors) and provides fallback mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the code includes surprise features that enhance the experience (e.g., 1. Real-time delivery progress indicators 2. Weather effects affecting delivery time 3. Customer satisfaction indicators). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "title": "Are there any redundant features?",
      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant SVG elements or groups that serve the same purpose 2. Visual elements unrelated to pizza delivery (e.g., unrelated animations) 3. Excessive effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary filter effects or complex gradients). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core visualization is obscured by redundant elements.",
      "maxScore": 10
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "title": "Does the code have engineering quality?",
      "description": "Review modular design (such as separating static/animated elements, appropriate use of SVG groups and reusable components), code organization, and maintainability. Deduct 5 points if there's no structure to the SVG elements; deduct 5 points if there's excessive inline styling instead of CSS classes; deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation between presentation and behavior in JavaScript. The full score is 10 points.",

    {
      "id": 8,
      "title": "Does the interface vision meet professional design standards?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the overall design follows modern design principles: 1) Harmonious color matching (no more than 3 primary colors) 2) Proper proportions and visual hierarchy 3) Consistent styling throughout the visualization. Deduct 3 points for each visual inconsistency, 5 points for clashing colors, and 5 points for unclear visual hierarchy. The full score is 10 points.",

      "id": 9,
      "title": "Is the dynamic interaction smooth and seamless?",
      "description": "Judge whether the animation and interactive elements conform to human perception characteristics: 1) Animation timing that feels natural (e.g., easing functions for acceleration/deceleration) 2) Transition duration appropriate for the action represented 3) Clear visual feedback for user interactions. Deduct 5 points for each animation that appears unnatural, 3 points for abrupt transitions, and 5 points for animations that run too quickly or slowly to be perceived properly. The full score is 10 points.",
