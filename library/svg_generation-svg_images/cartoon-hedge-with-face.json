Verify that the SVG can be rendered in a browser without errors. Deduct 3 points for missing namespaces, 3 points for improper viewBox, and 4 points if the SVG doesn't render correctly.

Check if the shape uses techniques like gradients or multiple layers to provide depth. Score 10 points for a realistic and visually appealing hedge, 5 points for a basic representation, and 0 points if the shape is not recognizable as a hedge.",

Check if the face is properly positioned on the hedge and is proportionate to the hedge size. Score 10 points for an expressive, well-integrated face with detailed features; 5 points if the face is basic but recognizable; 0 points if the face is missing or unrecognizable.",

Verify that the viewBox is properly set to maintain aspect ratio. Award 10 points for fully responsive design that scales without distortion, 5 points if it scales but with minor issues, and 0 points if the design breaks when resized.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no considerations for robustness are evident, give 0 points.",
