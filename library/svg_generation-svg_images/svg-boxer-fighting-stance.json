Check if the head, torso, arms, and legs are clearly defined using SVG shapes. Score 0 if the boxer is not recognizable, 5 if basic representation is present but proportions are off, and 10 if the boxer looks professionally designed with correct anatomical details.",

They should have the characteristic boxing glove shape with proper padding representation. Deduct 5 points if the gloves look unrealistic or poorly attached to the hands, and 3 points if the gloves lack defining details like wrist straps or shape contours. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate the realism of the punch trajectory, timing, and the coordination between arm movement and body weight shift.
