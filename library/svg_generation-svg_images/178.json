      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code correctly represents the essential components of earphones: two earbuds, a connecting band or wire between them, and a cord extending from them. Score 0 if any of these components are missing, 5 if they're present but proportions are off, and 10 if the entire structure accurately resembles standard earphones.",

Deduct 3 points if the earbuds lack dimension (appear completely flat), 4 points if essential details are missing, and 5 points if they don't resemble real earbuds. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for unnecessarily complex paths, 3 points for inefficient use of commands (e.g., using multiple line segments where curves would be better), and 4 points for not utilizing appropriate SVG elements for different components.",

Code with strong robustness should handle different display sizes properly, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if the SVG breaks on different screen sizes, give 0 points.",

Overly complex effects that add little visual value but increase code complexity. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the redundant code significantly increases file size or performance issues.",

Deduct 5 points if there's no logical grouping of elements; deduct 5 points if identical elements are duplicated instead of being reused; deduct 5 points if the file size is unnecessarily large due to poor optimization.

Deduct 3 points for anatomically incorrect proportions, 5 points for unrealistic or jarring color choices, and 5 points for overly simplistic rendering that lacks visual interest.
