Score 0 if fewer than 3 components are present, 5 if most components are included but with proportional issues, and 10 if all components are present with proper proportions and accurate representation.",

Check if the code leverages vector advantages like precise shape definitions and mathematical curves. Deduct 3 points if basic shapes are used when paths would be more appropriate, 5 points if the implementation relies on overly complex paths when simpler elements would suffice, and 5 points if the microscope lacks smooth curves where needed.",

Check that the creator effectively uses contrasting shades to create visual depth despite the monochrome limitation. Deduct 3 points if the image appears flat due to poor contrast management.",
