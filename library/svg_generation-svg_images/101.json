      "description": "Review whether the SVG code follows proper structure with appropriate viewBox, dimensions, and namespace. Check if the core elements (bride, groom, heart) are properly defined within the SVG. Score 0 if the SVG structure is missing or severely flawed, 5 if basic structure exists but with issues, and 10 if the structure is complete and standards-compliant.",

The bride should have a recognizable wedding dress (with details like veil, train, or lace) and the groom should have formal attire (suit or tuxedo). Deduct 3 points if one character's attire lacks detail, 5 points if both are overly simplified, and 7 points if attire is generic without wedding-specific elements. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if the heart's position doesn't clearly indicate it's above the couple, 3 points if the heart is poorly styled or too small to notice, and 2 points if the heart lacks thematic connection to the wedding concept (e.g., wrong color palette).

The couple should be centrally positioned with the heart forming a visual triangle.

Check for proper fallbacks, appropriate use of groups (<g> elements), and clean path definitions. Code with strong robustness should handle scaling gracefully and avoid rendering artifacts. Give 10 points for highly robust implementation, 5 points for average implementation with minor issues, and 0 points if the SVG breaks easily under different conditions.",
