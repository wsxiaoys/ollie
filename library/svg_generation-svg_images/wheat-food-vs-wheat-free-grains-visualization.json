Check if the SVG container is well-structured with appropriate dimensions and scaling properties. Deduct 5 points if the SVG lacks proper viewport settings, 3 points if responsive scaling is missing, and 5 points if namespace declarations are incorrect. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the visualization correctly portrays wheat's distinctive characteristics.

Check if the relationship between wheat and the broader cereal category is evident. Award 10 points if the cereal plant classification is clearly depicted through hierarchical organization, informative labeling, or comparative visualization; 5 points if the relationship is present but unclear; 0 points if this relationship is absent.",

Check if these alternatives are visually distinct from wheat while still showing they belong to the broader whole grain category.

Code with strong robustness should have comments explaining complex parts, defensive coding techniques, and browser compatibility considerations.
