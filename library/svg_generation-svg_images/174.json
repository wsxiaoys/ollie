      "title": "Is the basic bow structure correctly implemented in SVG?",
      "description": "Review whether the SVG code accurately renders the fundamental structure of a bow with proper curvature. The bow should include a curved limb structure (upper and lower limbs), bowstring, grip/handle section, and proper proportions. Score 0 if the basic bow shape is missing, 5 if only a simplistic representation is provided, and 10 if the bow includes detailed anatomical components.",

The string should appear taut and positioned correctly in relation to the bow's curve. Deduct 5 points if the string is missing or incorrectly positioned, and 3 points if the string-to-limb connection is unrealistic. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the grip/handle section is properly detailed with ergonomic design elements including a riser, arrow rest, and grip contours. A quality implementation should differentiate the handle material or color from the limbs. Deduct 3 points if the grip lacks detail, 5 points if the grip is anatomically incorrect, and 8 points if the grip is missing entirely. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively scale without distortion and render consistently across browsers. Give 10 points for highly robust code with viewBox, preserveAspectRatio and fallbacks. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if critical SVG attributes are missing, give 0 points.",
