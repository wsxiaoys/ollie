Please help me implement the following requirements using SVG code. The requirement is to create: a detailed black and white outline map of New Zealand.",

      "description": "Check if the SVG path accurately depicts New Zealand's shape including North Island, South Island, Stewart Island and other significant islands. The outline should be geographically accurate with proper proportions. Score 3 if only main islands are included, 7 if main islands with proper proportions, and 10 if all significant islands are accurately represented with correct geographical features.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the map uses appropriate viewBox dimensions and positioning to display the entire country without unnecessary empty space or cropping. The aspect ratio should match New Zealand's actual geography (roughly 3:10 height to width). Deduct 3 points if there's significant empty space, 5 points if any part of the map is cropped, and 3 points if the aspect ratio is distorted.",

Code with strong robustness should be cross-browser compatible and handle scaling appropriately. Give 10 points for robust implementation, 5 points for average implementation with minor issues, and 0 points if the SVG might fail in common browsers.",

Deduct 5 points if no SVG groups (<g>) are used to organize related elements; deduct 3 points if paths are not optimized; deduct 5 points if the SVG lacks appropriate reusable components.
