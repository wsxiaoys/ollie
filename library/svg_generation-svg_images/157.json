      "description": "Check whether the code accurately implements a recognizable cloud shape using SVG path elements or basic shapes (circles, ellipses) with appropriate overlapping. Score 0 if no cloud shape is present, 5 if a basic cloud outline exists, and 10 if the cloud has natural-looking curves with appropriate depth/dimension effects.",

Look for variations in drop size/length for realism. Score 0 if no rain is implemented, 5 if basic static rain exists, and 10 if the rain has natural variation and proper positioning relative to the cloud.",

Assess if the animation timing and easing functions create a realistic rain effect. Deduct 5 points if animations are jerky or unrealistic, and 3 points if animation performance is poor.

Code with strong robustness should be responsive to different viewport sizes and browser support.

Unnecessary scripts or styles that don't contribute to the core visualization.

Deduct 5 points for unnatural movement speeds, 3 points for jerky animations, and 5 points for animations that break the illusion of weather. The full score is 10 points.",
