Check if all 6 faces are properly defined with correct coordinates to form a cube shape. Score 0 if no cube is formed, 5 if the cube shape is incomplete or distorted, and 10 if all faces are properly positioned to form a perfect cube.",

Check if the projection technique creates a convincing 3D appearance and if the cube's dimensions appear proportional. Deduct 5 points if the projection looks flat or distorted, and 3 points if only simple 2D representation is used. The full score is 10 points.",
