      "description": "Review whether the code uses appropriate SVG elements (path, circle, ellipse, polygon) to construct the woman's profile silhouette. Check if the facial contours, hair outline, and facial features are accurately represented using vector graphics. Score 0 if basic SVG structure is missing, 5 if only simple shapes are used without proper profiling, and 10 if complex paths accurately depict feminine facial features and hair flow.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG implementation captures distinctive feminine features such as curved jawline, delicate nose bridge, and especially the long hair with flowing texture. Check if hair strands use smooth curves and layered paths to create realistic hair movement. Deduct 5 points if hair lacks volume or texture, 3 points if facial features appear too angular or masculine. Full score requires clear feminine silhouette with detailed hair rendering.",

      "description": "Check whether the SVG uses proper viewBox settings and coordinate systems that allow for responsive scaling. Evaluate if the proportions maintain accuracy across different screen sizes and if the vector graphics remain crisp at various zoom levels. Deduct 5 points if viewBox is not set correctly, 3 points if elements don't scale proportionally, and 2 points if stroke-width doesn't adapt to scaling.",

      "description": "Assess whether the implementation uses advanced SVG features like gradients for hair shading, clip-paths for layered hair effects, or multiple path segments for detailed facial contours. Check if bezier curves are used effectively to create smooth, natural lines. Give 10 points if advanced techniques create photorealistic effects, 5 points for basic gradients/curves, and 0 points for simple geometric shapes only.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common issues such as browser compatibility, rendering fallbacks, and proper error handling for unsupported SVG features. Code should include fallback mechanisms for older browsers and handle invalid viewBox parameters gracefully. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic compatibility measures, and 0 points if no edge cases are considered.",
