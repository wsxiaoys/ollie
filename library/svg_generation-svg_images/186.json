      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG path elements properly construct the distinct anatomy of a bulldog's face, including the wide jaw, wrinkled forehead, and flat nose. Check if the proportions are accurate (jaw width should be approximately 1.5x the width of the forehead). Score 0 if the basic structure is unrecognizable as a bulldog, 5 if the structure is recognizable but with anatomical inaccuracies, and 10 for anatomically correct representation.",

Score based on the emotional impact: 0 points if the expression is neutral or unclear, 5 points if only basic anger cues are present, and 10 points if the expression unmistakably communicates aggression and intensity.",

Check if the illustration effectively uses only black, white, and potentially grayscale values (no RGB colors outside grayscale). Assess contrast and balance in the monochrome design. Deduct 5 points if colors other than black/white/gray are used, and 3 points if the contrast is too low to clearly distinguish features. Full 10 points for masterful use of monochrome with proper shading techniques.",

Check for proper use of <path>, <circle>, <rect>, and other SVG elements. Deduct 5 points if inappropriate elements are used for specific features, and 3 points if features lack detail.

Check if the SVG includes proper structuring with groups (<g>) for logical organization of elements.

Unnecessary attributes that don't contribute to the visual output 3. Overly complex paths that could be simplified. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if redundancies significantly increase file size or render time.",
