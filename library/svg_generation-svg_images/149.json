      "description": "Review whether the SVG code correctly implements the groom's basic anatomical structure including head, torso, arms, and legs with proper proportions. The head should be approximately 1/8 of the total body height, shoulders should be 2-3 head widths, and the overall figure should follow human proportional guidelines. Score 0 if basic body structure is missing, 5 if proportions are noticeably incorrect, and 10 if anatomically accurate with proper scaling.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the tailcoat includes essential formal elements: peaked lapels, double-breasted or single-breasted front, proper tail length extending to behind the knees, fitted waist, and appropriate button placement. Check for formal accessories like bow tie, white dress shirt, and formal trousers. Deduct 5 points if the tailcoat lacks authentic cut details, 3 points if formal accessories are missing, and 2 points if the tail proportions are incorrect. Full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Is the SVG structure semantically organized and properly layered?",
      "description": "Check whether the SVG uses appropriate grouping with <g> elements, logical layer ordering (background to foreground), and semantic naming conventions. The code should separate different clothing elements (shirt, jacket, trousers) into distinct groups. Deduct 5 points if no grouping structure is used, 3 points if layer ordering causes visual conflicts, and 2 points if element naming is unclear. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for smooth curves using proper BÃ©zier controls, minimal path points, and accurate coordinate positioning. Deduct 5 points if paths are unnecessarily complex, 3 points if curves appear jagged, and 2 points if coordinates are not optimized. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code can handle common rendering issues across different browsers and screen sizes. The code should include proper viewBox settings, relative scaling, and fallback mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should handle edge cases like extreme viewport sizes and maintain visual integrity. Give 10 points if fully robust, 5 points if moderately robust, and 0 points if no robustness considerations are present.",

Overly complex effects that don't enhance the core design. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if redundant code significantly impacts file size or rendering performance.",

Deduct 3 points for each jarring color choice, 5 points for poor contrast making details hard to see, and 5 points for unbalanced composition. Full score is 10 points.",
