The SVG should have a reasonable size (e.g., 600x400 or similar) with properly set width/height attributes or responsive sizing.

Figure should have appropriate level of detail for a close-up view (facial features, clothing details, etc.).

White stripes should have consistent spacing and width relative to perspective. Deduct 5 points if perspective is completely wrong, 3 points if the stripes have inconsistent spacing/width, and 2 points if the stripes don't visually read as a crosswalk.

Check if the code handles potential rendering issues across browsers. Code with strong robustness should be maintainable and efficient, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if code is overly complex or brittle, give 0 points.",

Elements unrelated to the crosswalk scene (e.g., unrelated background objects), 3. Excessive detail that impacts performance (e.g., too many path points or unnecessary filters). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core image is obscured by redundant elements.",

Deduct 5 points if elements aren't logically grouped or named; deduct 5 points if the file size is unnecessarily large due to poor optimization; deduct 5 points if accessibility attributes are missing (e.g., role, aria-label, title elements).
