      "description": "Review whether the code correctly uses SVG elements to construct a sliding door structure, including door frames, door panels, tracks, and handles. Check if the geometric proportions are realistic and the structural relationships are logical. Score 0 if basic door structure is missing, 5 if only simple rectangles represent doors, and 10 if detailed architectural elements like frames, panels, tracks, and hardware are properly modeled with accurate proportions.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG implements proper black and white styling with appropriate use of grayscale values, stroke weights, and fill patterns. Check for consistent monochrome palette, proper contrast ratios, and effective use of shadows/highlights to create depth. Deduct 5 points if colors other than black, white, and gray are used. Deduct 3 points if contrast is insufficient for clear visibility. Full score requires sophisticated grayscale gradients and shading.",

      "description": "Check whether the implementation includes interactive sliding functionality through CSS animations or JavaScript, with realistic door movement along tracks. Evaluate if the sliding motion follows proper physics (easing, momentum) and visual feedback. Score 0 if no sliding interaction exists, 5 if basic CSS transitions are present, and 10 if smooth, realistic sliding mechanics with proper track constraints and momentum are implemented.",

Check if hardware elements are proportionally correct and positioned logically. Deduct 3 points for missing essential hardware components, 5 points if proportions are unrealistic, and 2 points for each misplaced architectural element. Full score requires comprehensive detailing.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as invalid SVG parameters, browser compatibility issues, animation glitches, etc.) and provide graceful degradation. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like viewport resizing, interaction conflicts, and rendering failures. Give 10 points if fully robust, 5 points if average robustness, and 0 points if no exception handling exists.",

Multiple door panels with synchronized movement 3. Interactive sound effects for sliding motion 4. Perspective transformation for 3D effect).

Unnecessary animations or effects unrelated to sliding door functionality 3. Overly complex path definitions that could be simplified. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core door visualization is interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if SVG structure is poorly organized or lacks semantic grouping; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if inline styles are overused instead of CSS classes.
