      "description": "Check if the SVG code includes the fundamental components of a rickshaw: chassis, three wheels (two at the back, one at the front), passenger compartment, and driver's seat. Deduct 3 points if any major component is missing, 2 points if proportions are unrealistic. Full implementation with correct proportions and structural integrity scores 10 points.",

Check if it renders properly across different browsers. Code with strong robustness should handle scaling appropriately without distortion.

Variable color schemes or styles). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Excessive detail that impacts rendering performance. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core representation is obscured by redundant elements.",

Deduct 5 points if element IDs/classes are missing or poorly named; deduct 5 points if the SVG contains unnecessary complexity or inefficient path definitions. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for each 20% increase in file size over an optimized equivalent, 5 points for unused definitions or attributes, and 5 points for overly complex paths that could be simplified.
