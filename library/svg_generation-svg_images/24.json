Look for proper proportions and realistic toilet shape. Deduct 5 points if major components are missing, 3 points for unrealistic proportions. Give 10 points for a complete and anatomically correct toilet representation.",

The flusher should have visual feedback (depression/movement) and trigger a flushing animation. Deduct 5 points if the flusher exists but isn't interactive, 3 points if interaction lacks visual feedback. The full score is 10 points for a fully functional and visually responsive flushing mechanism.",

Look for water swirl effects, changing water levels, and proper animation timing (2-4 seconds for a complete flush cycle).

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
