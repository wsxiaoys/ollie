      "description": "Check if the code properly creates a four-leaf clover using SVG path elements or shape combinations. The clover should have four distinct heart-shaped leaves arranged symmetrically. Deduct 5 points if the leaves don't resemble hearts, 5 points if the arrangement isn't symmetrical, and 10 points if fewer than four leaves are implemented. Full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for unnatural green shades, 5 points for flat single-color implementation without depth, and 3 points if no different shades are used for different parts (leaves vs. stem).
