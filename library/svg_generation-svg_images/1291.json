      "description": "Check whether the code correctly implements the five Olympic rings with standard colors (blue, yellow, black, green, and red) in the proper interlocking arrangement. The rings should be in the correct order from left to right: blue, yellow (behind), black, green (behind), and red. Proper spacing and alignment should be observed. Score 0 if rings are missing or incorrectly colored, 5 if basic implementation exists but with minor errors, 10 if perfectly implemented according to official specifications.",

According to official specifications, each ring should be of equal size, with proper spacing between rings (1/3 of ring diameter). The thickness of each ring should be 1/6 of the internal diameter. Deduct 3 points if proportions are incorrect, 3 points if spacing is wrong, and 4 points if the rings don't follow the official layout pattern. Full score for pixel-perfect implementation.",

Deduct 5 points if the rings don't scale appropriately on different screen sizes; deduct another 5 points if the layout breaks on mobile devices.

Deduct 3 points if using bitmap-based approaches that pixelate when scaled; deduct 5 points if the implementation causes excessive DOM elements or performance issues. Give 10 points for an efficient, scalable implementation using appropriate web technologies.",

Code with strong robustness should work across different browsers and handle edge cases. Give 10 points if the implementation works flawlessly across all major browsers, 5 points if minor compatibility issues exist, and 0 points if major rendering problems occur in common browsers.",

Excessive animation or interaction that compromises the official representation. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core presentation is negatively affected by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global variables are unnecessarily used; deduct 5 points if the code is not structured with proper functions or classes; deduct 5 points if hard-coded values are used instead of configurable parameters.
