      "title": "Is the rocket ship SVG fully implemented with proper shape elements?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the rocket ship using appropriate SVG elements (path, rect, circle, etc.). Check if the essential components of a rocket are present (body, fins, windows, nose cone). Score 0 if missing essential elements, 5 if basic shapes are present but lack detail, and 10 if the rocket is complete with proper proportions and details.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG includes proper XML namespaces, a well-defined viewBox attribute that frames the rocket appropriately, and preserveAspectRatio for responsive display. Deduct 3 points if SVG namespace is missing, 3 points for improper viewBox dimensions, and 4 points if responsive scaling isn't considered. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the rocket utilizes proper SVG color attributes, gradients (linear or radial) for realistic effects, and appropriate opacity where needed. Deduct 3 points for flat coloring without gradients, 3 points for unrealistic/inappropriate color choices, and 4 points if no attempt at shading or dimension is made. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for interactive elements (hover effects, clickable parts). Score 0 if no animation/interaction exists, 5 if basic animations are implemented, and 10 if comprehensive animations with user interaction are included.",

Code with strong robustness should include comments for complex sections and use defensive programming techniques. Give 10 points for comprehensive robustness, 5 points for average attention to these issues, and 0 points if completely neglected.",

Unused elements or attributes that add to file size without visual impact. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core elements are obscured by redundant code.",
