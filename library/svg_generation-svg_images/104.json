Ensure that the code you generate is executable for demonstration purposes.\nPlease help me implement the following requirements using code, specifically using SVG.

Award 10 points for a complete, anatomically correct representation; 5 points if the fish is recognizable but missing some key features; 0 points if the shape is too abstract to identify as a butterflyfish.",
