      "description": "Check whether the code accurately creates an infinity symbol (âˆž) using SVG path elements. The path should have a mathematically correct shape with proper curvature and symmetry. Score 0 if no infinity shape is visible, 5 if the shape is approximate but has flaws in symmetry, and 10 if the infinity symbol is perfectly formed with smooth curves and perfect symmetry.",

This should include appropriate grayscale effects, contrast adjustments, or filter combinations that mimic a photographic feel. Deduct 5 points if only basic black/white colors are used without any photographic effects, and 3 points if the effect lacks depth or realism. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that the viewBox is correctly set and all content is visible without cropping. Deduct 5 points if the symbol doesn't scale properly, and 3 points if parts of the graphic are cut off in some viewports. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should work reliably across modern browsers and degrade gracefully in older ones, giving 10 points.

Excessive use of filters that don't contribute to the photo effect 3. Unnecessary complexity that impacts render performance.
