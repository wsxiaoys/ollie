      "title": "Is the kitchen grater accurately represented in SVG?",
      "description": "Check if the SVG code properly renders a recognizable kitchen grater with appropriate structure (handle, body with holes/grating surface). Evaluate if the proportions are realistic and the grater has sufficient detail to be identifiable. Score 0 if the grater is unrecognizable, 5 if basic but lacking detail, 10 if properly detailed with accurate proportions.",

      "description": "Assess whether the cheese is visually distinct and realistically portrayed. Check if the shredded cheese particles look authentic and if the transformation from block to shreds is properly visualized. Deduct 5 points if cheese texture is unrealistic, 3 points if shreds lack dimension or variation, and 2 points if the cheese block appears too synthetic. Full score for realistic cheese with proper texture and convincing shreds.",

      "description": "Evaluate the animation showing the cheese being shredded against the grater. Animation should include the movement of cheese against the grater, creation of shreds, and proper timing. Score 0 if no animation exists, 5 if basic motion is shown but lacks realism, 10 if animation includes smooth movement, proper physics representation, and convincing transformation of cheese into shreds.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Unnecessary animations that don't contribute to the kitchen grater demonstration 3. Complex effects that slow down rendering performance. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functionality is compromised by redundant code.",
