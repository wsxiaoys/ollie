Check if appropriate SVG elements (rect, path, etc.) are used for the structure. Score 0 if the signpost is missing, 5 if it's basic but functional, and 10 if it includes detailed structural elements with proper proportions.",

Each arrow should have proper dimensions, clear directional indicators, and be visibly different from the others.
