      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code correctly depicts the eye's anatomical elements (sclera, iris, pupil, eyelids, tear ducts). Deduct 3 points if major anatomical structures are missing, 2 points if proportions are unrealistic. Full implementation with anatomical accuracy scores 10 points, basic implementation scores 5 points, and poor implementation scores 0 points.",

The animation should use appropriate SVG animation techniques (SMIL or CSS). Deduct 5 points if the animation is jerky or unrealistic, 3 points if timing feels unnatural. Full score requires physics-based movement with proper acceleration.",
