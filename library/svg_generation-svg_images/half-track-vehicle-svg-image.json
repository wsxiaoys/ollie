      "description": "Review whether the code accurately represents the half-track vehicle with correct proportions and key components (front wheels, rear tracks, cabin, body structure). Score 0 if the vehicle is unrecognizable, 5 if the basic structure is present but with significant distortions, and 10 if all essential components are accurately depicted with proper scaling and positioning.",

Deduct 2 points for each major missing detail. Award full points if the implementation includes nuanced details like rivets, suspension elements, and correct track mechanism visualization.",

Score 10 if the code demonstrates optimal structuring with reusable patterns for repeating elements (like track links), 5 if basic grouping is used but with inefficiencies, and 0 if the code is completely flat with no logical organization.",

Check if complex paths use proper curve commands (cubic/quadratic beziers) where appropriate rather than excessive straight line segments.

Check if the SVG scales correctly across different viewport sizes. Code with strong robustness should work across different browsers and adapt to container size changes, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if basic SVG requirements are not met, give 0 points.",

Overuse of filters or effects that impact performance without visual benefit. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core vehicle representation is obscured by unnecessary elements.",

Deduct 5 points for jarring animations, 3 points for interactions with delayed response, and 5 points for effects that distract rather than enhance. If no animation/interaction is included but the static image is excellent, score based on potential for adding such features. The full score is 10 points.",
