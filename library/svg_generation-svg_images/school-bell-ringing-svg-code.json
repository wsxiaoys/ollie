      "title": "Is the SVG bell structure accurately and completely implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a realistic bell structure using SVG elements, including the bell body (dome shape), clapper, handle/mounting system, and proper proportional relationships. Score 0 if only basic shapes are used without bell characteristics, 5 if basic bell outline is present but lacks detail, and 10 if a complete and recognizable bell structure with all components is implemented.",

      "title": "Is the ringing animation effect properly implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the SVG animation accurately simulates bell ringing behavior, including pendulum motion of the bell body, clapper movement inside the bell, and realistic swing patterns using SVG animations (animateTransform, animate). Deduct 5 points if only simple rotation is used without physics-based motion, and 3 points if the clapper doesn't move independently. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes visual representations of sound waves, vibration effects, or environmental context (like a school building, clock tower, or mounting structure). Check for creative visual indicators that enhance the 'ringing' concept such as radiating circles, particle effects, or contextual background elements. The full score is 10 points.",

      "title": "Is the animation timing and physics realistic?",
      "description": "Check whether the animation follows realistic physics principles with proper timing, easing functions, and momentum. The bell should swing with decreasing amplitude over time, and the clapper should move naturally relative to the bell's motion. Deduct 5 points if animations are linear without easing, and 3 points if the timing doesn't feel natural. Give 10 points if physics-based animation is fully implemented.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as browser compatibility issues, SVG rendering problems, animation performance on different devices) and provide fallback mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases and maintain functionality across different environments, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no error handling exists, give 0 points.",

Multiple bell types or customizable bell designs 3. Sound wave visualization patterns 4. Day/night environmental changes). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar animations (e.g., multiple swing mechanisms coexisting) 2. Elements unrelated to bell ringing (e.g., unrelated decorative objects) 3. Overly complex effects that don't enhance the bell concept. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core bell functionality is obscured by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if SVG structure is poorly organized or transformations are inefficient; deduct 5 points if animations are not optimized for performance; deduct 5 points if the code lacks modularity and reusability.

Deduct 3 points for unrealistic proportions, 5 points for poor color choices that don't represent a bell, and 5 points for inconsistent visual styling. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for choppy animations, 3 points for performance issues on standard devices, and 5 points for poorly optimized animation code. The full score is 10 points.",
