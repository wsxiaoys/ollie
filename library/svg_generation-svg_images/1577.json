      "description": "Verify if the code correctly generates a mathematically accurate heart shape. The heart should have a clear central V-point at the bottom, symmetrical lobes at the top, and smooth curves throughout. Deduct 5 points if the proportions are off, 7 points if the shape is distorted or asymmetrical. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the code leverages the chosen technology's strengths. Score 10 points for optimal technology choice with proper implementation, 5 points if the technology is appropriate but implementation is suboptimal, 0 points if an inappropriate method is chosen.",

The heart should maintain its proportions and quality regardless of the viewing device. Deduct 5 points if the heart distorts on resizing, 3 points if it doesn't adapt to the container size.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to heart drawing (e.g., unnecessary UI controls) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down rendering).
