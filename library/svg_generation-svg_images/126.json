Check if the SVG has proper width, height attributes and viewBox for responsive scaling. Deduct 5 points if viewport dimensions are not properly defined, 3 points if namespaces are missing, and 5 points if responsive scaling is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the implementation includes authentic details like barley's characteristic bushy head and spike-like appearance. Score 0 if no barley visualization is present, 5 if basic shape is implemented without characteristic details, and 10 if the visualization is botanically accurate and visually distinctive.",

Verify if the wheat ears show the classic drooping posture when mature and appropriate coloration. Score 0 if no wheat visualization is present, 5 if only basic wheat shape is implemented, and 10 if the visualization includes accurate botanical details and growth structure.",

Review whether the composition creates a cohesive agricultural scene rather than isolated plant elements. Deduct 3 points if plants are shown without context, 5 points if the composition lacks depth or perspective, and 2 points if the scene lacks agricultural relevance. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should gracefully handle rendering issues and be maintainable. Give 10 points for robust implementation, 5 points for average implementations, and 0 points if critical robustness features are missing.",
