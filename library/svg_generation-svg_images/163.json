      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code properly implements the basic structure of a computer monitor, including the screen, bezel, stand, and proper proportions. Check if the viewBox and dimensions are appropriately set. Score 0 if the monitor is not recognizable, 5 if only basic shapes are used without details, and 10 if the monitor looks realistic with appropriate perspective and dimensions.",

Buttons should have proper size, consistent spacing, and positioned logically on the monitor. Deduct 2 points if fewer than 5 different colored buttons are included, 3 points if button spacing is inconsistent, and 5 points if buttons lack visual affordance (like bevels, shadows, or hover states).

Check if there are comments explaining complex parts.

Code with strong robustness should use relative units, have fallback options, and avoid hard-coded values. Deduct 3 points for each critical browser compatibility issue, 2 points for missing viewBox attribute, and 5 points if the SVG breaks on resizing. The full score is 10 points.",

Excessive visual elements that distract from the main requirement.
