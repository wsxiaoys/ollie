      "description": "Check if the SVG implementation includes essential visual elements of currency: denomination markings, security features (watermarks, security threads), serial numbers, and proper proportions. Score 0 if basic currency shape is missing, 5 if only basic outline is present, and 10 if detailed elements including textures and security features are implemented.",

Check if complex details use proper techniques like gradient meshes or patterns instead of excessive path elements. Deduct 3 points for inefficient element choices, 4 points for missing essential SVG techniques like gradients for realistic shading, and 5 points if implementation relies solely on basic shapes without proper detail work.",

Check if proper width/height attributes or percentages are used. Deduct 5 points if the currency doesn't scale proportionally, and 5 points if viewBox is improperly configured causing display issues at different resolutions.",

Code with strong robustness should work across modern browsers and include fallback options. Give 10 points for comprehensive fallbacks and browser support, 5 points for average robustness with minor issues, and 0 points if major rendering problems occur across platforms.",
