      "title": "Is the SVG camera structure accurately implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the camera body structure through SVG elements, including essential components like camera body, lens, viewfinder, and flash. The structure should be proportionally correct and visually recognizable as a camera. Score 0 if basic camera shape is missing, 5 if only basic rectangular body is implemented, and 10 if all major camera components are detailed and proportionally accurate.",

      "title": "Is the shutter mechanism fully functional?",
      "description": "Check whether the shutter animation is implemented with realistic behavior, including shutter blade movement, opening/closing sequence, and proper timing. The shutter should have visual feedback that mimics real camera operation. Deduct 5 points if shutter animation is too simplistic, and 3 points if timing feels unnatural. Full score requires smooth, realistic shutter blade animation with proper easing functions.",

      "title": "Is the photo-taking interaction complete?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether the photo-taking process includes complete user interaction flow: shutter button press, camera shake effect, flash animation, and capture confirmation. The interaction should feel responsive and provide clear visual feedback. Deduct 5 points if missing flash effect, 3 points if no camera shake simulation, and 2 points if shutter button lacks proper hover/active states. Full implementation scores 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the code includes polished visual effects such as lens reflection, proper lighting gradients, shadow effects, and smooth transitions. The camera should have realistic material textures and professional visual appeal. Deduct 5 points if effects look flat or amateur, 3 points if gradients and shadows are poorly implemented, and 2 points if lens lacks realistic reflection effects. Full score requires professional-grade visual polish.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as rapid clicking, browser compatibility issues, animation interruptions, etc.) and provide stable performance across different scenarios. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases and maintain smooth operation. Give 10 points for excellent error handling, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if no exception handling is present.",

Photo preview/gallery feature 4. Different camera models/styles 5. Zoom functionality). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple animation triggers for same effect) 2. Function modules unrelated to camera operation (e.g., built-in games or irrelevant widgets) 3. Overly complex effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems or heavy filters). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core camera functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for proper use of SVG groups, clean DOM structure, and maintainable code patterns. Deduct 5 points if SVG structure is chaotic or lacks proper grouping; deduct 5 points if inline styles are overused instead of CSS classes; deduct 5 points if code lacks modularity and reusability.

Deduct 3 points for each unrealistic color choice, 5 points for poor proportional relationships, and 5 points for cluttered or unprofessional visual presentation. Full score is 10 points.",
