      "description": "Check if the SVG element is correctly defined with appropriate viewport dimensions, namespaces, and responsive attributes. The SVG should have proper width, height, and viewBox settings. Deduct 3 points if the SVG lacks proper viewport settings, 4 points if namespaces are missing, and 5 points if responsive design considerations are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the boxer's body parts (head, torso, arms, legs) are proportionally correct and positioned in a realistic fighting stance. Key elements include the boxer's center of gravity being slightly forward, one foot ahead of the other, knees slightly bent, and arms raised to protect the face. Deduct 3 points for each significant anatomical disproportion and 5 points if the stance doesn't resemble a realistic boxing position. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the boxing gloves are properly drawn with appropriate shape, size, and position. Boxing gloves should be oversized compared to hands, have distinctive wrist sections, and be positioned correctly on the boxer's hands. Deduct 5 points if the gloves are anatomically incorrect, 3 points if they lack detail or dimensionality, and 2 points if the color contrasts poorly with the boxer. The full score is 10 points.",

Look for shading on muscles, facial features, clothing creases, and glove textures. Deduct 3 points for flat, single-color representations with no depth, 5 points for missing critical details like facial features, and 2 points for inconsistent lighting direction.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code is well-structured, uses proper SVG elements for appropriate purposes (paths for complex shapes, basic shapes where applicable), and avoids unnecessary complexity. Code with strong robustness should be maintainable and efficient in its approach to drawing the boxer. Deduct 5 points for unnecessarily complex path definitions, 3 points for inappropriate element usage, and 2 points for inefficient grouping strategies. The full score is 10 points.",

Interactive elements that respond to user input 3. Realistic texture effects beyond basic shapes). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Overly complex effects that increase file size without visual benefit. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core visual elements are obscured by redundant elements.",
