      "description": "Evaluate whether the code creates a well-structured SVG with appropriate viewBox, dimensions, and organization. Check for proper path elements for roads, grouping of related elements, and proper layering. Score 0 if no SVG structure exists, 5 if basic structure exists but with issues, and 10 if the SVG structure follows best practices with proper organization.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements traffic visualization through color coding (e.g., green/yellow/red for traffic levels), animation effects for moving traffic, or other visual indicators. Check for proper legends or indicators that explain the visualization. Deduct 5 points if visualization is static only, and 3 points if the visual metaphors are confusing.

Look for event listeners, data fetching mechanisms (like fetch API or WebSockets), and data-driven attribute updates. Deduct 5 points if updates require page refresh, and 3 points if the update mechanism has significant delay (>2 seconds). The full score is 10 points.",

Give 10 points if multiple intuitive interactions are implemented, 5 points if only basic interactions exist, and 0 points if the map is entirely static.",

Code with strong robustness should degrade gracefully when features are not supported or data is unavailable, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Feature modules unrelated to traffic visualization (e.g., unnecessary animations) 3. Complex effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive filters or gradients that slow rendering). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
