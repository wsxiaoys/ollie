      "description": "Evaluate whether the astronaut figure is properly implemented using SVG path elements, groups, and shapes. The astronaut should include detailed components such as helmet with visor reflection, spacesuit with proper joints, backpack/life support system, and gloves/boots. Score 0 if the astronaut is overly simplistic (just basic shapes), 5 for moderate detail, and 10 for professional-level SVG structuring with proper layering and proportions.",

      "description": "Check if the space environment includes essential elements like stars (varied sizes/opacities), distant planets or celestial bodies, and possibly subtle nebula effects using gradient fills or filters. Assess if the background creates depth using multiple layers. Deduct 3 points if stars are uniform/unrealistic, 5 points if the environment lacks depth, and 3 points if there's no contrast between foreground and background. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Analyze the animation implementation for the floating astronaut. Look for smooth keyframe animations or SMIL animations with proper easing functions. The movement should simulate zero-gravity floating with subtle rotations and translations on multiple axes. Deduct 5 points if the animation is jerky/unnatural, 5 points if it's too simplistic (single-axis movement only), and 3 points if timing functions are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

These should enhance visual quality without causing performance issues. Check for use of <defs> for reusable elements.

Check for proper handling of aspect ratios and scaling. Code with strong robustness should work across different screen sizes and browsers. Deduct 3 points if the viewBox is improperly set, 3 points if there are no responsiveness considerations, and 4 points if browser compatibility issues exist. The full score is 10 points.",

Subtle particle effects for stars or thrusters 3. Dynamic lighting effects as the astronaut moves 4. Secondary animations like tethering cable or floating equipment).

Overly complex effects that don't enhance the visual narrative. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core visual elements are obscured by redundant elements.",
