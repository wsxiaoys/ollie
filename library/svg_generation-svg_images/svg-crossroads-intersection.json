Make sure the code you generate is executable for display whenever possible. Please help me implement the following requirement using SVG code: create a crossroads intersection.",

      "title": "Is the basic structure of the crossroads intersection correctly implemented with SVG?",
      "description": "Check if the SVG code properly defines the viewBox, dimensions, and namespace. Verify that the crossroads layout includes two perpendicular roads meeting at a central intersection point. Score 0 if there's no visible intersection, 5 if the basic structure exists but has alignment issues, and 10 if the roads are properly aligned and proportioned.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the roads are drawn with proper width, color, and border styling. Road markings should include center lines, stop lines, and lane dividers where appropriate. Deduct 3 points if road widths are inconsistent, 3 points if essential markings are missing, and 4 points if the styling lacks realism or professional appearance. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if these elements are completely missing, 5 if only some basic elements are present but poorly positioned, and 10 if the intersection has a complete set of traffic elements positioned according to standard traffic engineering practices.",

      "description": "Analyze if the implementation uses <g> elements to group related items, and whether it creates reusable components (like traffic lights or road markings) that can be used multiple times. Deduct 5 points if no grouping is used, and 5 points if the code has significant redundancy instead of creating reusable components. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle different viewport sizes, browser compatibility issues, and avoid rendering artifacts. Code with strong robustness should use relative positioning where appropriate and include fallbacks or error handling. Give 10 points for robust implementation, 5 points for average robustness, and 0 points if the SVG is likely to break under common viewing conditions.",

Elements unrelated to a crossroads intersection (e.g., buildings that distract from the main subject) 3. Overly complex effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive filter effects). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core representation is obscured by redundant elements.",
