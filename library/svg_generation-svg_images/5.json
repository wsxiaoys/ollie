      "description": "Check if the SVG code includes proper namespace, viewBox dimensions, and appropriate container elements. All SVG elements should be properly nested and have appropriate identifiers. Score 0 if SVG structure is missing or fundamentally flawed, 5 if basic structure exists but has issues, 10 if structure is complete and well-organized.",

Score 0 if no mess is visualized, 5 if a basic/abstract mess is shown, 10 if the mess has realistic texture, varied patterns, and appropriate coloring.",

Score 0 if the mop animation is absent, 5 if basic movement exists but appears mechanical, 10 if the mop moves naturally with convincing physics and cleaning patterns.",

Verify proper use of opacity changes, path morphing, or mask techniques. Score 0 if liquid simply disappears, 5 if basic transitions exist, 10 if transitions show realistic liquid behavior with wetness gradually receding.",

Check for proper use of viewBox scaling, responsive design principles, and cross-browser compatibility techniques. Code with strong robustness should work across major browsers and adapt to different viewport sizes, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no adaptation is considered, give 0 points.",

Unnecessary animations or effects unrelated to the cleaning visualization 3. Excessive filters or gradients that significantly impact performance.

Deduct 5 points if global IDs/classes are overused without proper namespacing; deduct 5 points if similar patterns are repeated without proper symbol definitions; deduct 5 points if the SVG lacks proper optimization (excessive precision in path data, unnecessary attributes).
