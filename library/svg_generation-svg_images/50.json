      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG includes proper viewport dimensions, viewBox attributes, and organized layer grouping (<g> elements) for different components (person, laptop, gears). Check if proper SVG namespaces are declared. Score 0 if basic SVG structure is missing, 5 if structure exists but lacks organization, 10 if well-organized with proper nesting and namespaces.",

Look for facial features, appropriate clothing details, and natural sitting position. Deduct 3 points if proportions are significantly off, 3 points if the sitting posture looks unnatural, and 4 points if facial/clothing details are completely missing.

Evaluate screen content visibility and keyboard detail level. Deduct 5 points if the laptop looks 2D or unrealistic, 3 points if essential elements are missing, and 2 points if the positioning relative to the person is implausible.

Evaluate if gears look like they could theoretically mesh. Deduct 3 points if gears lack tooth detail, 4 points if gears are randomly placed without purpose, and 3 points if fewer than 3 distinct gears are shown.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code avoids hardcoded magic numbers, uses variables/functions for repeated elements (like multiple gears), and implements reusable patterns. Check if the code would scale to different viewports without breaking. Code with strong robustness should handle different display contexts effectively. Give 10 points for highly reusable code, 5 points for average implementation, and 0 points if the code is brittle with many magic numbers.",

Gradient/lighting effects that give depth 4. Clever use of <clipPath> or masks). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Over-detailed elements that increase complexity without adding value. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if redundant code significantly impacts file size or readability.",

Deduct 5 points if the code lacks any reuse of repeated elements; deduct 5 points if there's significant path complexity that could be simplified; deduct 5 points if basic SVG optimization techniques aren't applied (like removing unnecessary decimal precision).
