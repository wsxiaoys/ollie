      "description": "Check if the code properly creates an SVG magnet with appropriate shapes, colors, and proportions. The classic horseshoe or bar magnet shape should be clearly recognizable with proper north/south poles indicated. Score 0 if no magnet is visualized, 5 if a basic shape is present but lacks detail, and 10 if the magnet is properly detailed with visual cues for polarity.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements a visual demonstration of magnetic attraction physics. Check for metal objects that respond to the magnet's proximity with appropriate movement behaviors. Deduct 5 points if attraction is static/predetermined instead of dynamic, and 3 points if the interaction radius isn't proportional to magnetic strength. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if no field lines exist, 5 if basic static field lines are present, and 10 if the field lines dynamically respond to movement or interaction with metal objects.",

Deduct 5 points if interaction is limited to basic dragging without physics, and 3 points if educational aspects of magnetism aren't clearly conveyed. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Fancy effects that affect performance without adding educational value about magnetism.
