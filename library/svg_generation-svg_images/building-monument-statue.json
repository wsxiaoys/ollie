      "description": "Review whether the SVG code creates a recognizable monument statue with proper proportions and structure. Check for essential architectural elements (base, column, statue/figure on top). Score 0 if the monument is unrecognizable, 5 if basic elements are present but with significant inaccuracies, and 10 if the monument is detailed and visually accurate.",

      "description": "Evaluate the structure of the SVG code: proper use of groups (<g>), logical organization of elements, semantic ID/class naming, and appropriate layering for visual hierarchy. Deduct 3 points if elements are not grouped logically, 3 points if naming conventions are inconsistent or meaningless, and 4 points if the code structure makes maintenance difficult. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the SVG includes visual details like texture (using patterns or gradient fills), shadows (using filters or opacity), and dimensional effects that enhance realism. Score 0 if no texturing/shadowing exists, 5 if basic techniques are applied, and 10 if advanced SVG filters and effects are used to create realistic monument rendering.",

      "description": "Assess whether the SVG uses proper viewBox attributes, preserveAspectRatio settings, and relative units to ensure the monument displays correctly across different screen sizes. Deduct 5 points if fixed dimensions are used instead of responsive techniques, 3 points if the viewBox is improperly configured, and 2 points if the monument distorts on resize.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as browser compatibility issues, rendering in different contexts, and fallbacks for unsupported features). Code with strong robustness should include browser-specific prefixes where needed, fallbacks for filters/effects, and clean rendering across browsers, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no compatibility considerations exist, give 0 points.",

Subtle animations that bring the monument to life 3. Day/night lighting effects). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Excessive filters or effects that slow down rendering without significant visual improvement. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core visual presentation is impaired by redundant code.",
