      "description": "Check if the code includes proper SVG structure with appropriate namespaces, viewport dimensions, and responsive design considerations. The SVG should have a well-defined viewBox for scaling. Deduct 5 points if namespace declarations are missing, 5 points if viewBox is incorrectly defined, and 3 points if responsive attributes are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for each missing critical component, 5 points if the proportions are significantly off, and 2 points if fine details like screw holes or write-protection notches are missing.

      "description": "Review how music is visually represented in the context of the cassette tape. Check if there are visual elements that convincingly represent music playing (e.g., animated tape movement between reels, equalizer bars, sound waves). Deduct 5 points if no music visualization is present, 3 points if the visualization is static rather than animated, and 2 points if the visualization doesn't logically connect to the cassette concept.

The animation should run at an appropriate speed and include proper easing functions. Deduct 5 points for jerky animations, 3 points for physically inaccurate movements, and 3 points if no animation timing control is implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should implement proper error handling and fallbacks. Deduct 3 points for each unhandled edge case, 5 points for browser-specific code without alternatives, and 5 points for performance issues with animations. The full score is 10 points.",

Fancy effects unrelated to cassette tape functionality. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core visual representation is obscured by unnecessary elements.",
