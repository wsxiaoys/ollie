      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the main pouring vessel (teapot, pitcher, gravy boat, etc.) using SVG elements with proper geometric structure and proportions. The vessel should have identifiable spout, handle, and body components with realistic proportions. Score 0 if no recognizable vessel is implemented, 5 if basic shapes are present but lack detail, and 10 if the vessel includes all structural elements with proper scaling and positioning.",

      "title": "Is the liquid pouring animation realistically implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the SVG animation accurately depicts liquid flow from the vessel using path animations, gradient effects, or particle systems. The animation should show liquid following realistic physics with proper arc trajectory, varying thickness, and natural flow dynamics. Deduct 5 points if the liquid flow lacks curvature or physics realism, and 3 points if the animation timing feels unnatural. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the liquid uses advanced SVG techniques such as gradients, filters, opacity effects, or masking to create realistic liquid appearance. The liquid should have proper color, transparency, and visual depth. Deduct 5 points if basic solid colors are used without gradients, and 3 points if no filter effects enhance the liquid realism. Check for splash effects or droplet details for full marks.",

The scene should show where the liquid is being poured and include supporting visual elements. Deduct 5 points if no receiving container is present, and 3 points if the scene lacks environmental context. Give 10 points if the composition includes multiple contextual elements creating a believable scene.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code can handle different viewport sizes, browser compatibility issues, and animation edge cases. The code should include proper viewBox settings, fallback mechanisms for unsupported features, and error handling for animation failures. Code with strong robustness should work across different browsers and screen sizes, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no compatibility considerations are present, give 0 points.",

Steam or aroma effects rising from hot liquids 3. Sound synchronization cues 4. Multiple liquid types with different properties). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Excessive decorative elements that distract from the main pouring action. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core pouring visualization is obscured by unnecessary elements.",
