Check if the base structure uses proper SVG elements (rect, path, circle, etc.) for the controller body.

Score 0 if the shape is unrecognizable as a controller, 5 if it has basic controller features but with proportional issues, and 10 if it accurately depicts a realistic game controller with proper proportions.",

The gray should be an appropriate shade (not too dark or too light) and the purple should be visually distinct. Deduct 5 points if the gray color isn't used for the body, 5 points if the buttons aren't purple, and 3 points if the shades chosen are inappropriate. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to render correctly across different browsers and contexts, giving 10 points. If there are minor issues that don't affect rendering, give 5 points, and if there are critical issues that break rendering, give 0 points.",

Unnecessary animations or effects that distract from the main visual.
