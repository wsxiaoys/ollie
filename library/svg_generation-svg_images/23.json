Check if the SVG element hierarchy follows best practices (e.g., grouping related elements with <g> tags, using descriptive IDs). Score 0 if SVG is not implemented at all, 5 if basic structure exists with minor issues, and 10 if structure is perfect with proper organization.",

The logo should match YouTube's official design specifications. Deduct 3 points if proportions are incorrect, 3 points if the play button is misshapen, and 5 points if the overall shape deviates significantly from the official logo. The full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate whether the sign provides sufficient contrast for the YouTube logo. Deduct 3 points if the dimensions are inappropriate, 3 points if the color is off-white or has transparency issues, and 5 points if the sign shape is poorly executed. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for the use of responsive techniques (preserveAspectRatio attribute, percentage-based dimensions, viewBox scaling). Code with strong robustness should work across major browsers and adapt to different contexts, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no scalability or compatibility considerations are made, give 0 points.",
