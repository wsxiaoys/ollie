      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG implementation accurately depicts a human figure playing an accordion. Check if the musician has proper body proportions, clear facial features, and a realistic posture that demonstrates accordion playing. Deduct 3 points if the figure lacks detail, 5 points if the posture is anatomically incorrect, and 7 points if the musician is barely recognizable. The full score is 10 points.",

The accordion should have both treble and bass sides with visible buttons/keys. Deduct 5 points if the accordion lacks a hexagonal button layout, 5 points if the bellows are missing or poorly represented, and 3 points if the instrument proportions are significantly incorrect.

The hands should be correctly positioned on the keyboard and bellows, with proper finger placement for playing. Deduct 3 points if hand positioning is unrealistic, 5 points if the hands don't connect with the accordion properly, and 7 points if the musician doesn't appear to be actually playing the instrument.

Score 0 if no animation exists, 5 if only basic bellows animation is implemented, and 10 if there are comprehensive animations including finger movements, bellows action, and possibly even visual cues for the polka sound production.

Check if the code uses groups (<g>) appropriately, implements proper viewBox settings, and has responsive scaling.

Over-complicated effects that make the file size unnecessarily large. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core representation is obscured by redundant elements.",
