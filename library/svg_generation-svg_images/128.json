      "description": "Review whether the SVG code accurately depicts the basic anatomical structure of a fish through path/polygon elements, including head, body, fins, and especially the prominent long tail feature. Check if the proportions are realistic and the body structure is coherent. Score 0 if basic fish shape is not recognizable, 5 if only basic outline is present, and 10 if all anatomical features including detailed fins, scales pattern, and elongated tail are properly rendered.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG implementation uses appropriate fill/stroke attributes to create clear black and white contrast without relying on color. Check if visual hierarchy is established through pure monochrome values (#000000, #ffffff, and grayscale variants). Deduct 5 points if any color other than black/white/gray is used, deduct 3 points if contrast ratio is insufficient for accessibility standards. Full score requires crisp black and white definition with proper shading gradients.",

      "description": "Assess whether the fish's long tail is the visual centerpiece with flowing, graceful curves using smooth SVG path commands (cubic bezier curves recommended). The tail should demonstrate dynamic movement and occupy significant visual space. Deduct 5 points if tail appears stiff or geometric, deduct 3 points if tail proportions don't emphasize the 'long' characteristic. Full score requires fluid, organic tail design that enhances the overall composition.",

Evaluate if the code uses semantic grouping (<g> elements) for logical parts and includes appropriate metadata. Deduct 5 points if paths are not optimized (excessive anchor points), deduct 3 points if no proper viewBox is set, deduct 5 points if code structure is chaotic without logical grouping. Full score requires clean, maintainable SVG architecture.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as browser compatibility issues, scaling problems, rendering errors) and includes fallback mechanisms or error handling. Code with strong robustness should work consistently across different browsers and screen sizes, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average with minor compatibility issues, give 5 points, and if no error handling or compatibility considerations are present, give 0 points.",

Layered depth through multiple SVG groups 4. Artistic texture patterns within the fish body). Add 3 points for each well-implemented innovative feature that enhances visual appeal without compromising the core requirement (maximum 10 points).",

Features unrelated to the fish illustration (e.g., background elements, decorative borders) 3. Overly complex effects that don't enhance the black and white fish representation. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core fish illustration is obscured by redundant elements.",

Check for clean path definitions, consistent naming conventions, and reusable elements.
