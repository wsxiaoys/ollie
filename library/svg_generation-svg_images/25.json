Check for correct use of path elements or complex shapes to form the hand. Score 10 points for realistic hand representation with proper shading and detail, 5 points for basic but identifiable hand structure, 0 points if the hand appears anatomically incorrect or unrecognizable.

Examine if z-index and layering are handled correctly where fingers overlap the phone. Score 0 points if fingers appear to pass through the phone, 5 points for basic contact representation, 10 points for realistic gripping with proper pressure points and natural finger positioning.

Elements unrelated to the hand-holding-phone focus (e.g., excessive background detail) 3. Overly complex filters or effects that impact performance.
