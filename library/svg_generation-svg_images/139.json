      "description": "Check if the code includes the fundamental camera body structure with proper dimensions and proportions. The camera should have a recognizable shape with main body, lens, viewfinder, and essential camera components. Score 0 if the shape is unrecognizable as a camera, 5 if basic outlines are present but with significant proportion issues, and 10 if the camera shape is professionally proportioned and immediately identifiable.",

Check if these components are positioned correctly in relation to each other. Deduct 2 points for each missing essential component (lens, viewfinder, shutter button, etc.). Deduct 3 points if the components have unrealistic positions or proportions. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Review whether the SVG elements are logically grouped (e.g., <g> elements for the camera body, lens, controls) with clear naming conventions. Check for proper nesting and structure that would facilitate future modifications. Score 0 if no grouping is used, 5 if basic grouping exists but lacks organization, 10 if components are logically grouped with descriptive IDs or classes that clearly indicate their purpose.",

      "description": "Assess whether the code differentiates between digital camera elements (LCD screen, memory card slots, digital controls) and traditional camera features. The implementation should clearly communicate which type of camera is being depicted or include elements from both if it's a hybrid representation. Deduct 5 points if there's no clear visual indication of camera type, and 3 points if digital elements are present but poorly implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the code avoids hard-coded absolute positions that might break in different screen sizes. Deduct 5 points if the viewBox is missing or improperly configured, 3 points if the SVG doesn't scale properly, and 3 points if browser-specific quirks aren't addressed.

Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if these redundancies negatively impact the rendering of the core camera image.",
