      "description": "Check if the code includes proper SVG namespace, viewBox definition, and appropriate dimensions. The SVG element should have width/height attributes or CSS styling that makes it responsive. Deduct 5 points if the SVG lacks proper viewport settings, 5 points if namespaces are missing, and 3 points if responsive design is not considered. The full score is 10 points.",

The face should show depth through shading and have realistic or stylistically consistent features. Score 0 if facial features are missing or severely distorted, 5 if proportions are slightly off but recognizable, and 10 if the face appears professionally crafted with proper anatomical understanding.

Hands should show proper perspective and include details like knuckles and fingernails. Deduct 5 points if hands appear anatomically incorrect, 3 points if the grip on the box looks unnatural, and 2 points if hands lack depth or detail. The full score is 10 points.",

Excessive or unnecessary detail that complicates the code without visual benefit 3. Over-complicated effects that could be achieved with simpler methods.
