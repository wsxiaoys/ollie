      "description": "Evaluate whether the code properly implements a realistic basketball sphere using SVG elements. The basketball should have the correct proportions (close to a circle), appropriate fill color (orange/brown), and proper depth perception. Deduct 5 points if the basketball shape lacks dimensional quality, 3 points if the proportions are incorrect, and 2 points if the coloring is unrealistic. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the SVG code includes the characteristic curved lines/seams of a basketball. A standard basketball has 8 seams forming curved panels. Verify that these lines are properly positioned, have appropriate curvature, and realistic width/color. Give 10 points for anatomically correct seam patterns with proper spacing and curvature, 5 points if basic lines are present but improperly positioned, and 0 points if seams are missing entirely.",

The official logo includes the team name 'KNICKS' above a basketball with 'NEW YORK' text. Verify proper positioning on the basketball surface with appropriate perspective distortion if needed. Award 10 points for an accurate logo with all elements, 5 points for a simplified but recognizable version, and 0 points if the logo is unrecognizable or missing key elements.",

This may involve techniques like partial visibility of the ball, detail enhancement, potential shadow/highlight effects to emphasize proximity, or other perspective techniques. Give 10 points for convincing close-up rendering with appropriate depth cues, 5 points if the perspective is present but not convincing, and 3 points if the image appears flat with no close-up qualities.",

Check for properly defined viewBox, preserveAspectRatio attributes, and responsive design considerations. Code with strong robustness should use relative units where appropriate and include fallback options. Give 10 points for fully responsive SVG that maintains proportions across viewports, 5 points for functional but fixed-size implementation, and 0 points if the SVG breaks in common scenarios.",
