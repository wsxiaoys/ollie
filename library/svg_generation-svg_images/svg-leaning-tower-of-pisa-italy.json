      "title": "Is the Tower of Pisa structure accurately represented?",
      "description": "Review whether the SVG code accurately captures the iconic architectural features of the Tower of Pisa: the cylindrical tower structure with multiple levels (8 floors), distinctive arched galleries on each level, the characteristic lean angle (approximately 3.97 degrees), and proper proportional relationships between tower height and width. Score 0 if basic tower structure is missing, 5 if only a simple leaning cylinder is implemented, and 10 if all architectural details including arches, columns, and proper proportions are accurately rendered.",

      "description": "Check whether the SVG includes detailed architectural elements such as: romanesque arched galleries, column capitals, blind arcades on the ground floor, decorative moldings between levels, and the bell chamber at the top. Evaluate the use of appropriate SVG elements (circles, paths, polygons) to create realistic architectural textures. Deduct 3 points for each missing major architectural feature, and 2 points for oversimplified decorative elements. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG demonstrates proper understanding of 3D perspective representation in 2D space: correct foreshortening of the leaning structure, appropriate shadow casting, depth perception through overlapping elements, and consistent vanishing point perspective. The lean should be visually convincing and geometrically accurate. Deduct 5 points if the perspective is flat or incorrect, 3 points if shadows are inconsistent with the light source. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the code includes contextual elements that enhance the landmark recognition: ground plane, surrounding buildings of Piazza dei Miracoli, sky background, and environmental details like trees or pathways. Evaluate whether these elements complement rather than overshadow the main structure. Deduct 5 points if no environmental context is provided, 3 points if the context elements are disproportionate or historically inaccurate. Full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code can handle common scenarios (different viewport sizes, browser compatibility, scaling without quality loss) and includes proper error handling for missing elements or malformed paths. Code with strong robustness should maintain visual integrity across different rendering contexts, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no stability considerations are implemented, give 0 points.",

Animated tourists or birds around the tower 3. Day/night lighting transitions 4. Subtle animation of the tower's lean progression over time). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant SVG elements achieving the same visual effect 2. Overly complex path definitions that could be simplified 3. Unnecessary decorative elements that detract from landmark recognition. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core landmark features are obscured by redundant visual elements.",

Deduct 5 points if code structure is chaotic or paths are not optimized; deduct 5 points if no reusable components are defined for repetitive elements; deduct 5 points if accessibility attributes are missing.

Deduct 3 points for unrealistic color choices, 5 points for poor contrast making details invisible, and 5 points for inconsistent artistic style. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if the tower could be mistaken for a generic leaning structure, 3 points if the lean is too subtle to be characteristic, and 5 points if architectural details don't support landmark recognition.
