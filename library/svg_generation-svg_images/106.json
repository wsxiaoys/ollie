      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code correctly renders a recognizable Chinese character with an elongated, flowing tail. The character should be clearly identifiable while maintaining aesthetic calligraphic properties. Award 10 points for a perfectly rendered character with appropriate stroke weight variation and authentic calligraphy style; 5 points if the character is recognizable but lacks some traditional calligraphic details; 0 points if the character is unrecognizable or missing the long tail feature.",

      "title": "Is the SVG path implementation technically sound?",
      "description": "Check if the implementation uses appropriate SVG path commands (M, L, C, Q, etc.) to create smooth curves and proper stroke connections. Examine whether the path data is optimized (not unnecessarily complex) while still capturing the essential calligraphic details. Award 10 points for expertly crafted paths with perfect curve control; deduct 3 points if paths show corner artifacts; deduct 5 points if paths are overly complex or inefficient.",

      "description": "Assess whether the SVG incorporates traditional Chinese calligraphy characteristics such as proper stroke order, pressure variations, and brush-like qualities. Review if stroke endings have appropriate tapering and if the long tail exhibits natural flowing qualities. Award full points for authentic calligraphy styling; deduct 5 points if the implementation lacks brush texture or pressure variation; deduct all points if the styling is completely inconsistent with Chinese calligraphy traditions.",

      "description": "Evaluate if the SVG successfully creates a close-up impression through appropriate scaling, framing, or detail emphasis of the character. Check whether viewBox, preserveAspectRatio and other SVG attributes are properly configured to maintain the close-up perspective. Deduct 5 points if the character appears distant rather than close-up; deduct 3 points if scaling issues distort the character; award 10 points for a perfectly executed close-up effect with proper detail emphasis.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code follows best practices for compatibility across browsers and devices. Check for proper namespace declarations, valid attribute usage, and fallback options when applicable. Code with strong robustness should work consistently across major browsers and screen sizes, giving 10 points. If robustness is average with minor rendering inconsistencies, give 5 points, and if significant cross-browser issues exist, give 0 points.",

Interactive elements that respond to mouse movements 3. Gradient or texture effects that simulate ink on paper). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Unnecessary SVG elements or groups that don't contribute to the visual 2. Overly complex path data that could be simplified 3. Decorative elements that distract from the main character. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core character visualization is interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if styles are hardcoded instead of using CSS where appropriate; deduct 5 points if the SVG contains unnecessary precision in decimal points; deduct 5 points if there are no comments explaining complex path constructions.

Deduct 3 points for cramped composition, 5 points for poor visual balance, and 5 points for colors that reduce character visibility. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for unnatural movement patterns, 3 points for jarring transitions, and 5 points for animations that run counter to traditional calligraphy techniques. The full score is 10 points.",
