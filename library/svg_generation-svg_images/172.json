The SVG should be properly structured with appropriate width, height, and viewBox values to ensure the image scales correctly. Score 0 if no SVG framework is provided, 5 if basic structure exists but with incorrect attributes, and 10 if the structure is complete and properly configured.",

Check for path precision, curve smoothness, and anatomical accuracy of the feather. Deduct 5 points if the basic shape is recognizable but lacks details, and 3 points if proportions are incorrect.
