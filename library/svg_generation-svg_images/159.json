      "description": "Evaluate whether the lipstick shape is accurately rendered with appropriate SVG elements (path, rect, etc.). The lipstick should include both the tube body and the colored tip part. Check if proper dimensions are used for proportionality, and if the overall shape resembles a realistic lipstick. Score 0 if no lipstick is visible, 5 if only a basic shape is implemented, and 10 if the lipstick has detailed components and realistic proportions.",

      "description": "Review the color choices used for the lipstick. The tip should be in an appropriate shade of red that looks like actual lipstick. The tube/case should have appropriate contrasting color (gold, silver, black, etc.). Points are deducted for unrealistic colors (e.g., blue lipstick tip), poor color matching between components, or lack of shading that makes the lipstick look flat. Score 0 if colors are completely inappropriate, 5 for basic coloring, and 10 for realistic lipstick coloring with appropriate shading.",

      "description": "Check whether the implementation uses appropriate SVG techniques such as gradients, shadows, highlights, or patterns to enhance the realism of the lipstick. Evaluate use of techniques like linear/radial gradients for glossy effects, filter effects for shadows, or path manipulations for precise shapes. Deduct 5 points if no enhancement techniques are used, and 3 points if techniques are used but poorly implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the positioning creates a coherent image that communicates the lipstick as a beauty accessory. Deduct 5 points if the lipstick is floating without context, and 3 points if positioning is awkward or unrealistic. Full points for thoughtful positioning that enhances the presentation.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to render consistently across modern browsers and screen sizes, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no considerations for robustness are made, give 0 points.",

Unnecessary animations or effects that distract from the main subject. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core subject (lipstick) is obscured by redundant elements.",

Deduct 5 points if elements are not properly grouped or named; deduct 5 points if the code contains duplicated patterns that could be optimized; deduct 5 points if the implementation unnecessarily increases file size through inefficient techniques.
