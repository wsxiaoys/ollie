      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code accurately implements all essential parts of a bicycle: frame (including top tube, down tube, seat tube, seat stays, chain stays), wheels (with spokes and hubs), handlebar, seat, pedals, and chain. Score 0 if more than two essential components are missing, 5 if only one component is missing or poorly implemented, and 10 if all components are properly structured with appropriate proportions.",

      "description": "Check whether the bicycle's proportions follow real-world bicycle geometry: wheels should be of equal size, the frame should form proper triangles for structural integrity, and components should have realistic dimensions relative to each other. Deduct 3 points if the wheels are disproportionate, 3 points if the frame geometry is structurally unsound, and 4 points if overall proportions make the bicycle appear unrealistic. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 10 for exemplary implementation with optimized path commands and transforms, 5 for functional but unoptimized implementation, and 0 for implementation with significant technical flaws.",

Check for defensive coding practices like avoiding hard-coded absolute positions. Score 10 for fully responsive implementations that work across all modern browsers, 5 for partially responsive implementations, and 0 if the design breaks easily on different screen sizes.",
