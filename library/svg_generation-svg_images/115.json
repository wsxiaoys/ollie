      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the primary anatomical features of the human ear (outer ear, middle ear, inner ear) through SVG paths and elements. Score 0 if only a simplified outline is created, 5 if the main visible structures are implemented, and 10 if all anatomical structures (including internal components like cochlea, auditory canal, etc.) are accurately represented with proper proportions.",

Verify that the helix, antihelix, tragus, lobule, and other ear components are accurately represented. Deduct 3 points for each significant anatomical inaccuracy, and 5 points if the proportions between different ear parts are incorrect. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper use of groups (<g>), reusable components (symbols, defs), and efficient path commands. Deduct 3 points for inefficient SVG structure, 5 points for missing viewBox definition, and 3 points for unnecessarily verbose path commands. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for hover explanations, animated sound wave visualization, or labeled anatomical parts. Score 0 if the image is purely static with no educational elements, 5 if basic labels or tooltips are included, and 10 if comprehensive interactive educational features explain the hearing process.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle edge cases like resizing, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no safeguards are implemented, give 0 points.",

Unnecessary animations or effects unrelated to ear function demonstration 3. Excessive detail that impacts performance without adding educational value. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core anatomical representation is obscured by redundant elements.",

Deduct 3 points for each anatomical misrepresentation, 5 points for confusing or unrealistic coloring, and 5 points for poor visual hierarchy that makes structures difficult to distinguish.
