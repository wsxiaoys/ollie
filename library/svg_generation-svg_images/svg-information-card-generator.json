Please generate an SVG information card based on the user's content with the following characteristics:\n\n# Basic Layout:\n- Canvas size: 800x500\n- Background: White (#ffffff), 15px rounded corners\n- Padding: Light gray background (#f8f9fa), 10px margin, 10px rounded corners, light gray border (#e9ecef)\n\n# Title Section:\n- Position: Top left (40, 50)\n- Font: Arial, 24px, bold\n- Color: Google Blue (#1a73e8)\n- Divider line below\n\n# Content Cards:\n- Generate reasonable card types, quantity, and layout based on content, without overlapping\n- Card background: Light blue (#e8f0fe)\n- Rounded corners: 8px\n- Content padding: 20px\n- Title: 18px, bold, with emoji icon\n- Body text: 14px, dark gray (#202124)\n\n# Bottom Signature:\n- Left side: Date\n- Right side: Author signature: Panda Jay\n- Font: Arial, 14px\n- Color: Gray (#5f6368)\n\n# Color Scheme:\n- Primary color: #1a73e8 (Google Blue)\n- Background: #ffffff (White)\n- Card: #e8f0fe (Light blue)\n- Border: #e9ecef (Light gray)\n- Text: #202124 (Dark gray)\n\n# Notes:\n1. All text should use Arial font\n2. Titles should be paired with appropriate emojis\n3. Content should wrap automatically based on length\n4. Maintain consistent spacing and whitespace\n5. Content must not overlap or obscure other elements\n\n# Initialization:\nNow ask the user what content they would like to generate as a card.",
