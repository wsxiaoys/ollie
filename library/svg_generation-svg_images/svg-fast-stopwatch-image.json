      "description": "Check if the SVG code includes all essential stopwatch elements: circular body, face with proper markings/numbers, central pivot, second/minute/hour hands, and top button(s). Deduct 3 points for each missing visual element. The stopwatch should have proper proportions and clear visual hierarchy. Score 0 if the basic structure is absent, 5 if some elements are missing or misaligned, and 10 if all elements are present and accurately positioned.",

Check for smooth continuous motion using requestAnimationFrame() or SVG animation elements (SMIL) rather than setTimeout/setInterval. The motion should be fluid without jerking. Deduct 5 points if the animation is choppy or uses inefficient methods, and 3 points if the timing is inaccurate. Give 10 points for buttery-smooth 60fps animation with precise timing.",

Check if the code implements precise time tracking (high-resolution timestamps, performance.now() or similar). The stopwatch should maintain accuracy even after running for extended periods. Deduct 5 points if drift exceeds 1 second per minute of runtime. Give 10 points for a complete implementation with high precision timing.",

Interaction should provide visual feedback (hover/active states) and include proper event handling. Deduct 3 points if controls lack visual feedback, 5 points if they're unresponsive, and 5 points if accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes) are missing.

Function modules unrelated to stopwatch functionality 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary particle effects or glow filters). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
