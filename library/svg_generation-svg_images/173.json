      "description": "Evaluate whether the code correctly represents a bell shape with appropriate curves, dimensions, and proportions. The bell should have a dome shape, a clapper inside, and possibly a mount at the top. Score 0 if no recognizable bell shape is present, 5 if the basic shape is there but lacks detail, and 10 if the bell is accurately portrayed with proper dimensions and elements.",

      "description": "Check if the code includes animation for the bell ringing motion (swinging or vibrating) and potentially for the clapper hitting the bell sides. The animation should be smooth and represent a realistic bell movement. Deduct 5 points if only static elements are implemented, and 3 points if the animation exists but is choppy or unrealistic.

The audio should trigger appropriately with the visual movement.

The interaction should be intuitive and responsive. Deduct 5 points if interaction exists but has noticeable lag or is unintuitive, and 10 points if no interaction is implemented.

Function modules unrelated to the bell visualization (e.g., unnecessary UI controls) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive particle systems or filters). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
