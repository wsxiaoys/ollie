      "description": "Check if the SVG code correctly defines a rocket ship with appropriate shapes (body, windows, fins, etc.). Examine whether the geometric elements are properly constructed with correct coordinates and dimensions. Score 0 if no rocket is visible, 5 if basic shapes are present but disproportionate, and 10 if the rocket has proper proportions and identifiable components.",

Deduct 5 points if the background is plain or missing, 3 points if it lacks depth or context, and 2 points if the stars or elements are too uniform. The full score is 10 points.",

Assess if the motion path is realistic (upward trajectory, possible slight curve), if there's proper easing (acceleration/deceleration), and if the animation duration is appropriate. Deduct 5 points if there's no animation, 3 points for jerky movement, and 2 points for unrealistic timing. The full score is 10 points.",

These should change dynamically during the launch sequence. Deduct 5 points if effects are missing entirely, 3 points if they're static, and 2 points if they lack variation or realism.

Code with strong robustness should work across modern browsers and scales appropriately.

Overly complex effects that impact performance without adding value.
