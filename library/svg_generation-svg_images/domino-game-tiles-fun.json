Score 0 if basic domino representation is missing, 5 if tiles are created but with visual defects, 10 if tiles look professional with proper dimensions and styling.",

Function modules unrelated to dominoes (e.g., unnecessary mini-games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down gameplay).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if SVG elements are generated inefficiently or without proper organization.
