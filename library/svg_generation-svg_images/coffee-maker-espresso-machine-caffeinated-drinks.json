The requirement is to create: This coffee maker made caffeinated drinks using an espresso machine.",

      "title": "Is the basic SVG coffee maker structure properly implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the code provides a complete SVG structure with proper viewBox dimensions and organization of components (machine body, water tank, filter holder, steam wand, etc.). Score 0 if essential coffee maker components are missing, 5 if basic structure exists but lacks detail, and 10 if all coffee maker components are accurately depicted with proper scaling and positioning.",

      "title": "Does the SVG implement animation for the coffee-making process?",
      "description": "Evaluate whether animations are implemented showing the coffee-making process (water flowing, espresso brewing, steam generation). Check for proper use of SVG animation elements (<animate>, <animateTransform>, etc.) or SMIL animation. Deduct 5 points if animations are jerky or unrealistic, and 3 points if key brewing steps are missing. Full score requires smooth, continuous animation showing the complete brewing cycle.",

      "title": "Is user interactivity properly implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the SVG includes interactive elements that allow users to operate the coffee maker (clicking buttons, adjusting settings, starting the brewing process). Review event handlers, cursor changes, and visual feedback on interaction. Deduct 5 points if basic interaction is missing, 3 points if interaction lacks visual feedback. Full score requires complete, intuitive interaction flow from bean selection through beverage dispensing.",

      "title": "Is the caffeine-making visualization explicit and educational?",
      "description": "Assess whether the visualization effectively demonstrates how an espresso machine extracts caffeine during brewing (pressure mechanics, extraction process, etc.). Score 0 if no educational aspect exists, 5 if the process is shown but without clear explanation of caffeine extraction, and 10 if the SVG clearly illustrates the science of caffeine extraction in espresso production with proper visual cues or indicators.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG code handles common edge cases (browser compatibility, responsive sizing, script failures) and provides appropriate fallbacks. Code with strong robustness should include responsive viewBox settings, appropriate namespaces, and defensive coding patterns. Give 10 points for comprehensive robustness features, 5 points for average implementation, and 0 points if major robustness issues exist.",

SVG elements unrelated to a coffee maker (e.g., decorative elements that clutter the visualization) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive filter effects or gradients). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if SVG structure is chaotic or lacks organization; deduct 5 points if there's excessive duplication of path definitions or styles; deduct 5 points if animations are hardcoded rather than parameterized. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG design follows modern design principles: 1) Harmonious color matching (materials like stainless steel, glass, and coffee represented realistically) 2) Proper proportions and perspective (coffee maker elements in correct relation to each other) 3) Professional finish (appropriate use of gradients, shadows for depth). Deduct 3 points for each unrealistic visual element, 5 points for poor perspective/proportion issues, and 5 points for flat, unrealistic rendering. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for unrealistic timing, 3 points for abrupt animations without easing, and 5 points for missing visual feedback on important state changes. The full score is 10 points.",
