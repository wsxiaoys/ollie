      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements SVG elements using proper vector graphics principles, including correct use of paths, shapes, and coordinate systems for both thumbs up and thumbs down icons. Check if the hand anatomy is proportionally correct and visually recognizable. Score 0 if basic SVG structure is missing, 5 if only basic shapes are used without proper hand details, and 10 if anatomically accurate hands with proper thumb positioning are fully implemented.",

Check if the positioning creates effective visual contrast and the composition follows design principles. The icons should be easily distinguishable and properly aligned. Deduct 5 points if only one icon is implemented, 3 points if the positioning lacks visual balance, and 2 points if the icons are too similar in appearance. Full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if the illustration maintains visual quality at different sizes and uses appropriate stroke-width and fill properties. Deduct 5 points if the SVG uses excessive path points or redundant elements, 3 points if scaling issues are present, and 2 points if stroke-width is not properly defined. Full score is 10 points.",

Check if accessibility attributes like aria-labels, role definitions, and meaningful element IDs are implemented.

Overly complex implementations where simple solutions would suffice.
