      "description": "Review whether the SVG code accurately depicts the fundamental elements of a Japanese kimono including the main body (hon-mi), sleeves (sode), collar (eri), and obi (sash). Check if the proportions follow traditional kimono measurements where sleeve length typically extends to ankle level and body width allows proper draping. Score 0 if basic kimono silhouette is missing, 5 if only simplified outline is present, and 10 if all structural elements are properly proportioned and positioned.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the SVG includes authentic Japanese design elements such as traditional patterns (seigaiha, asanoha, sakura, etc.), proper color combinations following seasonal conventions, and accurate collar overlap (left over right). Check for cultural authenticity in decorative motifs and pattern placement. Deduct 5 points if patterns are culturally inappropriate, 3 points if collar overlap is incorrect. Full score requires authentic traditional elements.",

      "description": "Assess whether the SVG uses appropriate technical approaches including proper use of groups (<g>), paths, and geometric shapes for efficient rendering. Check if the code utilizes SVG-specific features like gradients, patterns, and transforms effectively. Evaluate if the coordinate system is well-organized and if the viewBox is properly configured. Deduct 5 points if excessive nested elements cause performance issues, 3 points if basic SVG optimization principles are ignored.",

      "description": "Review whether the SVG successfully simulates the natural draping characteristics of kimono fabric through curved lines, shadow effects, and layering. Check if the obi (sash) shows proper dimensional depth and if sleeve draping appears natural. Evaluate the use of gradients or shading to create fabric texture illusion. Score 0 if completely flat representation, 5 if basic draping attempt, 10 if realistic fabric simulation with proper depth and natural flow.",

Check for proper error handling in path definitions, valid color values, and scalable design elements. Code with strong robustness should render consistently across platforms, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if major rendering issues exist, give 0 points.",

Excessive decorative elements that distract from the main subject. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if core kimono elements are obscured by redundant code.",
