The SVG should have appropriate width/height attributes or viewBox for scaling. Deduct 5 points if namespace is missing, 5 points if dimensions are hardcoded without responsiveness considerations, and 3 points if viewBox is improperly configured. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper hierarchy, alignment, and proportions. Score 10 points for complete implementation with proper layout hierarchy, 5 points if basic components are present but poorly arranged, and 0 points if the layout lacks fundamental UI organization.
