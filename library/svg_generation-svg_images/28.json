Deduct 3 points if namespace is missing, 3 points for improper viewBox setup, and 4 points for lack of logical grouping (<g> elements). The full score is 10 points.",

Give 3 points for basic shape representation, 7 points for a detailed cliff with texture, and 10 points for a visually compelling cliff with proper perspective. Deduct points if the cliff appears flat or poorly integrated into the scene.",

Score 3 points for a basic stick figure, 7 points for a properly proportioned body with distinguishable limbs, and 10 points for a detailed human figure with appropriate falling posture and visible facial features. Deduct points for anatomical errors or unnatural posing.",

The parachute should appear to be catching air and slowing the descent. Score 3 points for basic shape, 7 points for proper structure with strings, and 10 points if the parachute shows realistic inflation and proper connection to the person.

Good practices include descriptive IDs, clean path definitions, and appropriate use of SVG elements. Deduct 3 points for each significant error like invalid attributes or conflicting definitions.

Elements that distract from the core scene (falling person with parachute). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core elements are obscured by redundant visuals.",

Deduct 5 points if the code uses absolute positioning everywhere instead of relative positioning; deduct 5 points if there's excessive hard-coding instead of parametrization; deduct 5 points if optimization techniques like path simplification are ignored.

Deduct 5 points if no animation or animation hooks are present, 3 points if animations are jerky or unrealistic, and 5 points if animation timing is inappropriate for the scene.
