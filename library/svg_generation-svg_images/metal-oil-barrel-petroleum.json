      "description": "Check if the SVG code properly renders a recognizable metal oil barrel with appropriate proportions (typical 55-gallon drum proportions of approximately 23\" diameter Ã— 34\" height). The barrel should include key visual elements such as rim reinforcements at the top and bottom, side vertical ribbing if applicable, and proper cylindrical perspective. Score 0 if the barrel is unrecognizable, 5 if it's basic but identifiable, and 10 if it's detailed and realistic.",

If applicable, check if the filling level is visible through an open top or semi-transparent representation. Deduct 5 points if petroleum is missing entirely, 3 points if the coloring is incorrect (e.g., bright colors not resembling petroleum), and 2 points if there's no distinction between the barrel and its contents.",

Check for reflective properties, appropriate metal texture or pattern, and depth perception. For the petroleum, evaluate if its liquid properties are suggested through appropriate visual cues.

Check if the implementation uses appropriate SVG features like gradients, patterns, or filters for visual effects rather than numerous overlapping elements.

Check if the implementation works across different viewports and scales appropriately. The robust code should handle various display scenarios without breaking the visual representation. Give 10 points for highly robust code that scales well, 5 points for code that works in limited scenarios, and 0 points if the SVG implementation has fundamental structural issues.",

Unnecessary nested groups or transforms that complicate the structure 3. Overly complex effects that don't contribute to the oil barrel visualization.
