      "description": "Evaluate whether the code properly implements product listings with image thumbnails, price display, and basic product information. Check if products can be sorted or filtered. Score 0 if the listing functionality is missing, 5 if basic listings are implemented but lack sorting/filtering, and 10 if comprehensive product display with filtering options is included.",

Verify if there are multiple product images with a gallery/carousel view. Deduct 3 points if image zoom is missing, 3 points if seller details are incomplete, and 3 points if product specifications are insufficient. Full score is 10 points.",

Check for input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks and form validation before submission. Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to second-hand trading (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations or heavy background processing). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 3 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 3 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 4 points if the layout breaks on different screen sizes.
