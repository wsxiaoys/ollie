      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the menu display with proper categorization (appetizers, main dishes, desserts, drinks), item details (name, price, description, image), and filtering/sorting capabilities. Score 0 if the core display logic is missing, 5 if only basic listing is implemented, and 10 if comprehensive menu features including search/filter/categorization are fully included.",

The system should handle order validation, pricing calculation (including taxes and fees), and provide order summaries. Deduct 5 points if the cart functionality is incomplete, and 3 points if order modification capabilities are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if time conflict resolution is not implemented, and 3 points if there's no handling of restaurant capacity constraints. Give 10 points if fully implemented.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to food ordering (e.g., a built-in news feed) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when scrolling through menu). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for visual after-images during fast scrolling through the menu, and 5 points for hard-to-find key function buttons (like checkout or add to cart).
