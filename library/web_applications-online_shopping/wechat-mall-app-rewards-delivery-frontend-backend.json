  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you generate is executable whenever possible. Write a WeChat mall application that includes sign-in rewards, lottery rewards, product categorization, in-store redemption, express delivery options, and directly applicable frontend and backend code. Also provide clear installation and practical usage instructions.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements product management (CRUD operations), shopping cart functionality, order processing workflow, and payment integration through frontend/backend architecture. Check if product categorization with filtering/search is properly implemented, and whether inventory management is included. Score 0 if core shopping features are missing, 5 if only basic product display is implemented, and 10 if complete e-commerce workflow including payment processing is fully functional.",

Check if lottery system implements fair probability distribution, prize inventory management, and user participation limits. Deduct 5 points if reward algorithms are exploitable, 3 points if user progress tracking is inaccurate. Verify integration with user points/credits system and reward redemption flow.

      "description": "Check whether the system properly handles two distinct fulfillment workflows: in-store pickup with QR code generation/scanning and express delivery with shipping integration. Evaluate if inventory is properly allocated between channels, location-based store selection is implemented, and delivery tracking is functional. Deduct 5 points if inventory conflicts between channels exist, 3 points if store location services are missing. Full score is 10 points.",

Check if WeChat Mini Program APIs are properly utilized and user session management follows WeChat guidelines. Deduct 5 points if WeChat Pay integration is missing or non-functional, 3 points if user authentication flow has security vulnerabilities. Verify social sharing and Mini Program compliance.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like concurrent user actions, session timeouts, and API failures, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to mall operations (e.g., built-in games unrelated to rewards) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations during checkout).

Deduct 5 points if database relationships are poorly designed or lack proper indexing; deduct 5 points if APIs lack proper validation or documentation; deduct 5 points if no environment configuration management exists.
