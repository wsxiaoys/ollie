      "title": "Is the pre-order system UI properly implemented?",
      "description": "Check whether the code accurately implements the product categorization UI (Pork Products, Beef Products, Fish, Vegetables) with clear visual hierarchy and proper labeling. Score 0 if categories are not implemented, 5 if basic categories exist but without visual distinction, and 10 if categories are clearly styled with proper headers and section separators.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of the tiered discount system (¥4 off over ¥50, ¥10 off over ¥100, ¥22 off over ¥200). Check for correct mathematical calculations, proper threshold detection, and whether discounts are automatically applied to eligible orders. Deduct 3 points if discounts are not applied automatically, 4 points if the calculation logic is incorrect, and 3 points if discount thresholds are not properly detected.

      "description": "Check whether the shopping cart includes essential functions like adding/removing items, quantity adjustment, real-time price calculation, and subtotal display. The system should maintain item counts accurately and apply discounts correctly. Deduct 3 points if quantity management is missing, 3 points if real-time calculation is absent, and 4 points if the cart doesn't persist during the session. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as out-of-bounds input, network interruption, user operation errors, etc.) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple discount calculation methods) 2. Function modules unrelated to pre-ordering (e.g., a built-in game while waiting) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations on product listings). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not automated.

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for visual after-images during fast scrolling through product lists, and 5 points for hard-to-find key function buttons.
