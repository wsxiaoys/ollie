Can you help me create a web project - a standard e-commerce system with Vue 2 for the frontend, Spring Boot and MyBatis for the backend, and MySQL for the database?",

      "description": "Evaluate the Vue 2 implementation, including proper component hierarchy, Vuex state management, Vue Router configuration, and lifecycle hooks usage. Check for single-file component structure, proper props validation, and event handling. Score 0 if Vue is not implemented, 5 if basic Vue implementation exists but with architectural issues, and 10 if implemented following Vue best practices with proper separation of concerns.",

Check for proper exception handling, input validation, and response formatting. Deduct 5 points if missing proper layering, 3 points if missing global exception handling, and 2 points if REST API endpoints don't follow standard naming conventions. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, pagination implementation, and optimization techniques like result caching.

Check for proper handling of e-commerce specific entities (products, orders, users, carts).

Check for input validation on both frontend and backend, proper error handling, and logging. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to e-commerce (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core e-commerce functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for proper use of design patterns, code style consistency, and build automation tools. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are misused; deduct 3 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 2 points if the build process is not automated.
