  "question": "You are a code expert, please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be careful to ensure that the generated code is executable when demonstrated. Well, let me explain my requirements: my WeChat Mini Program needs to have functionality for collecting coupons, payment capabilities, and the ability to view products. Can you help me write this kind of code? And could you tell me where to modify the relevant code?",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code includes a complete coupon system with collection, storage, and usage mechanisms. Check for 1) Coupon listings page, 2) Collection interaction, 3) Coupon detail view, 4) Storage in user account, and 5) Expiration management. Score 0 if core coupon functionality is missing, 5 if basic collection is implemented without management features, and 10 if the full coupon lifecycle is managed.",

Ensure the code includes proper security measures like signature validation. Deduct 5 points if the payment flow is incomplete, 3 points if error handling is missing, and 5 points if security validations are absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to the core requirements (e.g., unnecessary social features) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., complex animations on product pages).
