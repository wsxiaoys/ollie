      "description": "Review whether the code implements comprehensive filtering capabilities including price ranges, categories, brands, ratings, etc. Check if the filters can be combined and applied simultaneously with proper state management. Score 0 if filtering is not implemented, 5 if only basic filtering is available, and 10 if advanced features like filter history, quick reset, and saved filter preferences are included.",

Deduct 5 points if rendering causes noticeable lag on mobile devices, and 3 points if no optimization techniques are used. Full score requires implementing both client-side caching and progressive loading.",

Check for proper component organization and reusability. Deduct 5 points if still using Options API, 3 points if refs are overused instead of reactive, and 5 points if no reactive state management solution is implemented.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to product filtering (e.g., unneeded social sharing) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations on filter changes).
