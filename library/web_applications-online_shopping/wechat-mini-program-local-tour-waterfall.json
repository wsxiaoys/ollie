  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the generated code is executable. I am creating a WeChat Mini Program as my graduation project, and now I need to create a \"Local Tour\" interface. This interface mainly adopts Taobao's waterfall flow style to display tourism products (such as a large image + title: One-day Tour of Shunde + price). Please implement this interface and its logic, providing code from scratch.",

      "description": "Check whether the code correctly implements the waterfall flow layout with dynamic height calculation. The implementation should handle images of varying heights, ensure columns are balanced, and maintain responsive behavior across different device widths. Score 0 if waterfall flow is not implemented, 5 if basic implementation with fixed heights, and 10 if fully dynamic with optimal column balancing algorithm.",

Check for correct use of Mini Program components (instead of HTML), proper page lifecycle methods, and adherence to WeChat's development guidelines. Deduct 5 points if using web-based approaches incompatible with Mini Programs, and 3 points if not utilizing built-in capabilities effectively. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for proper image handling (lazy loading, error handling), text truncation for long titles, and price formatting with currency symbol.
