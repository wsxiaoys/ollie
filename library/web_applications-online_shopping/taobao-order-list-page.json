      "description": "Examine whether the code includes all essential components of a Taobao order list: header with logo and search functionality, navigation menu, order filtering options, order items with product images/details/prices, pagination controls, and footer. Score 0 if missing more than half of these elements, 5 if missing 1-2 key components, and 10 for complete implementation.",

Test if filters update the displayed orders appropriately. Score 0 if no filtering exists, 5 if only tab filtering works, 10 if all filtering options are functional.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to an order list (e.g., product recommendation carousel) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Check for: 1) Proper color usage matching Taobao's brand 2) Consistent spacing and alignment 3) Typography hierarchy matching Taobao's style.
