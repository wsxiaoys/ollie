Create an APP: \"All Samples\" The concept behind this APP is that contemporary beauty product prices are rising, and while we young people don't have income sources, we still want to use high-end brand cosmetics. This APP specifically sells product samples, allowing users to buy authentic products while saving money. The backend uses IDEA, the frontend uses HarmonyOS, and the database uses MySQL.",

Check if it includes product authentication mechanisms, sample size specifications, and expiration date tracking. Score 0 if core product management is not implemented, 5 if only basic CRUD operations exist, and 10 if comprehensive sample-specific features (batch tracking, authenticity verification, size variants) are fully included.",

Verify if sample quantity limits, bulk purchase discounts, and secure payment processing are implemented.

Check if the IDEA backend provides RESTful APIs with proper error handling and data validation. Deduct 5 points if database queries are not optimized, and 5 points if API responses exceed 500ms.

Verify if the UI follows HarmonyOS design guidelines and utilizes platform-specific animations and gestures. Deduct 5 points if generic mobile UI patterns are used instead of HarmonyOS native components, and 3 points if cross-device continuity features are missing.

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle edge cases like concurrent inventory updates and payment processing failures, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to sample commerce (e.g., built-in social media feeds) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive product image animations).
