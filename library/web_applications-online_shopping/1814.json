Score 0 if the carousel is not implemented, 5 if only basic sliding is included, and 10 if all features are properly implemented with optimized performance (preloading images, efficient animation).",

Products should be organized by categories relevant to international trade (e.g., by country, industry, or certification). Deduct 3 points if products lack critical information, 3 points if categorization is poor, and 4 points if there's no filtering/sorting functionality. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if media queries are implemented correctly and if the carousel maintains functionality across devices.

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as missing images, slow network connections, user interaction errors, etc.) and provide friendly error handling or fallbacks. Code with strong robustness should include image error handling, graceful degradation, and form validation. Give 10 points for comprehensive error handling, 5 points for basic error handling, and 0 points if errors crash the functionality.",

Function modules unrelated to international trade products (e.g., unrelated social media feeds) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or 3D effects).
