      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the key structural components of JD.com's homepage, including the primary navigation bar, promotional banner carousel, product grid display, and category sidebar. Score 0 if the basic structure is missing, 5 if only partial components are implemented, and 10 if the complete JD.com layout structure is replicated with proper responsive design principles.",

Check if the implementation includes breadcrumb navigation, proper grid/list view options, and pagination functionality. Deduct 5 points if the category system is oversimplified, 3 points if filtering options are missing, and 2 points if pagination is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

The code should handle cart item management (add, remove, update quantity) and preserve cart data across sessions.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to e-commerce (e.g., a built-in game center not present in JD) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations causing lag).
