Check if avatar, nickname, content, rating (star), and timestamp are displayed properly. Deduct 5 points if data binding is incorrect, 3 points if the list doesn't handle empty states, and 3 points if pagination isn't implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Score 0 if images are not handled at all, 5 if basic image display is implemented, and 10 if the implementation includes a full image gallery with preview and zoom capabilities.",

      "description": "Verify whether the timestamp (createtime in Unix format) is properly converted to a human-readable format. Check if the implementation uses relative time (e.g., '2 hours ago') or absolute time with proper localization. Score 0 if timestamps are displayed as raw Unix timestamps, 5 if basic formatting is applied, and 10 if the implementation handles various time formats with proper localization.",

Check if changes to the list are properly reflected in the UI, whether computed properties and watchers are used appropriately. Score 0 if reactive binding is broken, 5 if basic reactivity works but has edge case bugs, and 10 if the implementation fully leverages Vue's reactivity system.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as missing data fields, network errors when fetching reviews, display issues with unusually long content, etc.) and provide friendly error handling or fallbacks. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to reviews (e.g., unnecessary user profile sections) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 3 points for each crowded visual element, 5 points for a glaring color combination, and 5 points for chaotic text-image layout. The full score is 10 points.",
