      "description": "Review whether the code implements the essential components of a WeChat Mini Program order system: pages for product listing, product details, shopping cart, order confirmation, and order history. Check for proper navigation flow between these components. Score 0 if core pages are missing, 5 if basic pages exist but lack proper connections, and 10 if the complete order flow is implemented with all necessary transitions.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code correctly uses WeChat-specific APIs like wx.request for network calls, wx.login for authentication, wx.payment for payment processing, and wx.getUserInfo for user profiles. Deduct 3 points if any critical WeChat API is missing, 5 points if APIs are used incorrectly, and 7 points if no WeChat-specific APIs are utilized at all. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check whether the code includes proper data storage using wx.setStorage/getStorage for local data, cloud database for remote persistence, and whether it handles synchronization between offline and online states. Evaluate if the shopping cart state persists across app restarts. Deduct 3 points if only local storage is used without cloud backup, 5 points if data can be lost during navigation, and 7 points if no persistence mechanism exists. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for payment status verification and receipt generation. Deduct 5 points if the payment flow lacks security measures, 3 points if receipt/confirmation is missing, and 7 points if the entire payment process is simulated without actual WeChat Pay integration.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to order placement (e.g., built-in games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the ordering process). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or MVVM pattern is not followed; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if custom components are not created for reusable elements.

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for jerky animations or transitions, and 5 points for interactions that feel non-native to the WeChat environment.
