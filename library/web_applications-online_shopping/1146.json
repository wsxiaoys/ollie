Check if all required input validations are in place. Score 0 if the core booking flow is missing, 5 if only partial functionality is implemented, and 10 if the complete end-to-end booking process is implemented with proper state management.",

Verify integration with WeChat payment APIs if applicable. Deduct 3 points if essential WeChat APIs are not used, 5 points if they're used incorrectly, and 10 points if all necessary WeChat APIs are properly implemented and error-handled.",

Verify that data binding, event handling, and conditional rendering are implemented correctly.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to hotel booking (e.g., an unnecessary social sharing feature) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations when scrolling through hotel options).
