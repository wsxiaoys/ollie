Score 0 if there's no form validation, 5 if basic validation exists but lacks comprehensive checks (password strength, email format), and 10 if it includes comprehensive validation with helpful error messages and AJAX submission without page refresh.",

Deduct 3 points if password masking toggle is missing, 5 points if there's no proper error handling for failed login attempts, and 5 points if the form lacks security features like CSRF protection or rate limiting hints.",

      "description": "Assess whether the notification system works properly upon successful login, displaying a clear message that doesn't disrupt UX. The notification should be dismissible, appropriately positioned, and styled according to UI standards. Score 10 for an elegant toast/modal with animation and personalized welcome message, 5 for a basic static alert, and 0 if the notification is missing or malfunctioning.",

Check for media queries, flexible layouts, and touch-friendly UI elements. Deduct 3 points for each breakpoint where the layout breaks (mobile/tablet/desktop), 5 points if input fields aren't properly sized for mobile devices, and 5 points if touch targets are too small (<44px).",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to registration/login (e.g., a full product catalog) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations that slow page loading). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
