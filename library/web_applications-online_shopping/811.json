  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure the code you generate is executable and demonstrable. I am a junior student majoring in software technology, and here are the subjects I've studied: 1. Using HTML and CSS to develop commercial websites 2. Introduction to programming 3. LINUX basics 4. Object-oriented programming 5. MYSQL database management 6. JavaScript programming 7. Database systems and applications 8. Dynamic website development (PHP) 9. HTML5+CSS3 development 10. WEB client development 11. Website construction and management. I need you to complete my request based on what I've learned. I want to use Vue and Bootstrap for the frontend to create a simple secondhand goods shopping website. Please combine the above requirements to create a simple graduation project and the corresponding website.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the essential product listing features including product cards, search functionality, filtering, and categorization. Check if the product detail view shows complete information (price, condition, seller info, description, images). Score 0 if the core listing system is missing, 5 if only basic listing is implemented without search/filter, and 10 if all features including advanced search filters are fully included.",

Check if the authentication uses proper security practices (token-based auth, secure password storage). Deduct 5 points if no authentication is implemented, 3 points if it lacks profile editing capabilities. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if form validation is implemented for all inputs. Deduct 5 points if image upload is missing, 3 points if form validation is incomplete, and 5 points if editing functionality is absent.

Verify if the transaction workflow includes order confirmation, contact information exchange, and transaction history.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Price history tracking 4. Social sharing integration). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

Function modules unrelated to secondhand shopping (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or transitions). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or Vue best practices are not followed; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no build process is implemented.
