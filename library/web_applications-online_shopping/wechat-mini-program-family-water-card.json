Verify the proper implementation of the application lifecycle functions. Score 0 if the basic structure is incorrect, 5 if the structure is present but incomplete, and 10 if it follows all WeChat Mini Program best practices.",

Check for WeChat Payment API integration, balance calculation, and proper error handling during payment processes. Deduct 5 points if payment verification is missing, 3 points if receipt generation isn't implemented, and 2 points if transaction records aren't stored properly. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points if notifications aren't implemented correctly, 3 points if reminder scheduling is inflexible, and 2 points if there's no usage pattern analysis. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to water card management (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations).
