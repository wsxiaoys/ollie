Design a WeChat Mini Program for shopping that can search and compare prices of the same products across different websites, identify the lowest priced item, and allow direct purchase within the mini program. Please generate source code for this mini program that can be directly copied and used.",

      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements the search functionality that can query products across different e-commerce platforms, and if it correctly extracts and compares pricing data. Score 0 if the core search functionality is not implemented, 5 if only basic searching is available without proper price comparison logic, and 10 if the system can effectively search, normalize, and compare prices from multiple sources with proper sorting options.",

Evaluate if the system properly handles edge cases like identical prices, different shipping costs, or seller ratings affecting the overall value. Score 0 if no lowest price identification exists, 5 if basic comparison exists but doesn't account for additional costs/factors, and 10 if comprehensive price analysis with visual indicators is implemented.",

Evaluate the approach for handling different data structures, authentication requirements, and rate limiting from various sources.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to shopping comparison (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations on product listings).
