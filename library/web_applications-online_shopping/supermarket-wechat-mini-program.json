      "description": "Review whether the code follows WeChat mini-program framework requirements, including correct use of app.js, app.json, app.wxss for global configurations, and proper page structure. Check that page lifecycle methods (onLoad, onShow, etc.) are correctly implemented. Score 0 if mini-program structure is missing, 5 if basic structure exists but with incorrect implementation, and 10 if fully compliant with WeChat development standards.",

Check if products can be properly sorted and filtered by category, price, popularity, etc. Score 0 if categorization is missing, 5 if basic categorization exists but lacks sorting/filtering, and 10 if the system includes hierarchical categories with multiple sorting and filtering options.",

Check for order submission, payment integration with WeChat Pay, and order confirmation. Deduct 5 points if pricing rules are incorrectly applied, 3 points if quantity management has bugs, and 2 points if the checkout flow is incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify that both item lookup and checkout can be performed via barcode scanning. Deduct 5 points if the scanner doesn't properly integrate with product database, 3 points if error handling for invalid barcodes is missing, and 2 points if performance is poor.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to supermarket shopping (e.g., social media sharing unrelated to purchases) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down the interface). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state management is chaotic; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no automated testing exists for critical flows like checkout.
