      "description": "Review whether the code includes essential e-commerce components: header with search functionality, navigation menu, product carousel/banner, featured products grid, category navigation, and footer. Score 0 if the basic structure is missing, 5 if partial implementation exists, and 10 if all core components are properly structured and responsive.",

      "description": "Evaluate the Vue component hierarchy and data flow. Components should follow single-responsibility principle, with clear parent-child relationships and proper props/events communication. Deduct 5 points for global state overuse when local state is sufficient, 3 points for prop drilling beyond 3 levels, and 5 points for missing key Vue lifecycle hooks. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 3 points for incorrect brand colors, 5 points for missing or improper logo placement, and 3 points if the overall visual doesn't match JD's signature style. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for lazy-loading of images and infinite scrolling or pagination. Deduct 5 points if product cards lack essential information, 3 points for inefficient rendering of large lists, and 5 points for poor category navigation. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to e-commerce (e.g., built-in games) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or Vue best practices are not followed; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the build process is not properly configured.
