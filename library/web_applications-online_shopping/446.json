Check if single-file components (.vue files) are used with appropriate template, script, and style sections. Components should be modular and reusable. Score 0 if minimal Vue integration is implemented, 5 if basic Vue structure is present but with improper organization, and 10 if the component architecture is fully compliant with Vue 2 standards including props validation, lifecycle hooks, and proper data/computed property usage.",

The code should handle loading states, error conditions, and successful data retrieval.

Verify if it includes listing, pagination, filtering options, and the ability to add/remove items from favorites. Check if item cards display appropriate information (image, name, price, availability).

Function modules unrelated to an agricultural marketplace (e.g., social media features not tied to farm products) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations on produce listings).
