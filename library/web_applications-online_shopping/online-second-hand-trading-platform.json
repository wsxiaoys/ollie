  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to make the generated code executable and demonstrable. Please develop an online second-hand goods trading platform where users can post and browse information about used items. The product listing should support sorting by price, posting time, and seller rating. The detail page should display product images, descriptions, and seller information. The shopping cart should include a negotiation feature allowing users to initiate price negotiations with sellers and complete payment after a deal is reached.",

      "description": "Check if the code implements a responsive product grid with the required sorting options (price, posting time, seller rating). The implementation should include proper filtering mechanisms and smooth re-sorting without page refresh. Score 0 if the listing is not implemented, 5 if only basic listing without sorting is available, and 10 if all sorting features work correctly with visual feedback for active sorting.",

Function modules unrelated to second-hand trading (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations on product cards).
