Please help me create a webpage for an e-commerce site that needs to showcase images and text content. The design preference is for a minimalist European feel, and you can handle the rest as you see fit.",

      "description": "Review whether the HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation includes a responsive product grid, product detail views, and effective image handling techniques. Score 0 if the core product display functionality is missing, 5 if only basic product showcasing is implemented, and 10 if the showcase includes features like image zoom/gallery views, product filtering, and smooth transitions between product views.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of minimalist European design principles including ample whitespace, restrained typography (preferably sans-serif), muted color palette (whites, grays, with minimal accent colors), and focus on product presentation rather than decorative elements. Deduct 3 points for each design element that contradicts minimalist European aesthetics (e.g., busy patterns, excessive colors, cluttered layouts). Award full points only if the design achieves elegant simplicity with purposeful negative space.",

Deduct 2 points for each missing navigation element and 3 points if the navigation is not persistent across the site. Review the mobile navigation adaptation – deduct 5 points if the mobile menu is not properly implemented or accessible.",

Evaluate whether the code implements semantic HTML elements for proper information hierarchy. Deduct 5 points if product cards lack essential information and 5 points if the information architecture doesn't prioritize key purchasing decision factors.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to e-commerce showcase (e.g., unnecessary social media widgets) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations or heavy background videos).

Deduct 5 points if global CSS/JS pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance optimizations are implemented (image optimization, code splitting, etc.).
