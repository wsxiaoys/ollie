  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Be sure to ensure that the generated code is executable for demonstration purposes. Please help me create a performance management system based on Vue, which includes: ticket purchasing, pre-sales, performance type inquiries, personal ticket purchase records, and payment methods. The database uses MySQL, the backend uses Java Web, and the frontend uses the Vue framework. Please include detailed code.",

      "title": "Is the Vue frontend architecture properly implemented?",
      "description": "Review whether the code properly implements Vue's component-based architecture, uses Vue Router for navigation, Vuex for state management, and follows Vue's best practices. Check if components are properly organized, reusable, and implement proper props validation. Score 0 if Vue is not used effectively, 5 if basic Vue functionality is present but with architectural issues, and 10 if the implementation follows Vue best practices with proper component lifecycle management.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code implements all steps in the ticket purchasing flow: browsing events, seat selection, reservation, checkout, and confirmation. Check if the system handles concurrent seat selection, maintains seat reservation status, and implements timeout for reserved but unpurchased tickets. Deduct 3 points if seat visualization is missing, 3 points if reservation timeout is not implemented, and 4 points if concurrent booking issues are not addressed. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Check if the pre-sales module includes announcement functionality, countdown timers, reminder settings, and waiting list management. For performance inquiries, verify if filtering by types, dates, venues, price ranges, and search functionality are implemented. Deduct 3 points if pre-sales lack notifications, 3 points if waiting lists are not implemented, and 3 points if performance filtering is limited. 10 points if fully implemented with user-friendly interfaces.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether personal ticket records include purchase history, active tickets, e-ticket display with QR codes, and refund/exchange capabilities. For payments, check integration with multiple payment gateways, secure transaction handling, and payment status tracking. Deduct 3 points if e-tickets lack proper display, 3 points if payment gateway integration is incomplete, and 3 points if refund processes are missing. The full score is 10 points.",

      "description": "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as network failures during payment, session timeouts, concurrent transactions, database connection issues) and provide friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Virtual venue tour before purchase 3. Social sharing with personalized ticket images 4. Event recommendations based on purchase history). Add 2.5 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",

      "description": "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple payment processing methods that do the same thing) 2. Function modules unrelated to performance management (e.g., a built-in game while waiting) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., heavy animations on ticket pages). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

      "description": "Review modular design (such as separating API services, UI components, and business logic), test coverage, and build process automation. Check if proper API abstraction layers and data models are used. Deduct 5 points if global state is misused; deduct 3 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 3 points if the build process is not automated; deduct 2 points if security measures for database access are inadequate.
