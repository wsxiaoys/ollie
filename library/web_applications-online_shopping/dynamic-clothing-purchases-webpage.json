      "description": "Review whether the code implements a responsive clothing display system that shows products dynamically, with proper filtering, sorting, and search capabilities. Score 0 if the core display logic is missing, 5 if only basic display is implemented, and 10 if the system includes advanced features like dynamic filtering, sorting options, and search functionality with autocomplete.",

Deduct 5 points if interactive elements are missing, 3 points if color/size selection doesn't visually update the product, and 2 points if zoom/detailed view options are absent.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to clothing purchase (e.g., unnecessary games or distracting elements) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down browsing). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the website doesn't adapt to mobile devices.
