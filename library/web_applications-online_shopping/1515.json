      "description": "Check if the code provides a comprehensive structure with all three required pages (home page, information page, personal profile page) and proper navigation between them. Score 0 if any of the three main pages are missing, 5 if basic pages are implemented but lack proper navigation, and 10 if all pages are fully structured with seamless navigation implementation.",

Deduct 2 points for each missing core feature. The home page should load efficiently with lazy loading or pagination for product listings. Score 10 points for complete implementation with optimized loading.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to e-commerce (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations slowing down product browsing). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no performance optimization is implemented.
