      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements key homepage components: banner slideshow, navigation icons, product recommendations, and promotional sections. Check if data loading and rendering are properly handled (lazy loading for performance). Score 0 if the homepage structure is missing, 5 if basic layout is implemented without dynamic features, and 10 if the homepage closely resembles JD's with all core components functioning properly.",

      "description": "Evaluate the implementation of the two-level or three-level category navigation system, including primary categories, sub-categories, and product listings. Check if category data is properly structured, if navigation between categories is smooth, and if category filtering works correctly. Deduct 5 points if only a flat category structure is implemented, 3 points if transitions between categories are abrupt. Full score of 10 points requires smooth scrolling, proper caching of category state, and visual hierarchy matching JD's design.",

Verify if cart state persists across app navigation and if calculations for subtotals, discounts, and shipping are accurate. Deduct 5 points if quantity adjustment doesn't work properly, 3 points if price calculations are incorrect. Full score of 10 points requires all cart functions working with proper validation and state management.",

Check if the layout follows JD's design patterns and if navigation to sub-sections works correctly. Deduct 5 points if user data management is missing, 3 points if navigation to sub-sections doesn't work.

Check for proper error boundaries and fallback UI components. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to an e-commerce app 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations, unnecessary 3D effects).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or if Vue component composition is poorly structured; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no consideration for multiple platform compatibility.
