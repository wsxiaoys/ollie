Check if global styles are defined in app.wxss.

Evaluate whether the product listings include high-quality image display with lazy loading, detailed product information (materials, dimensions, pricing), and multi-angle product viewing. Deduct 5 points if the product structure is illogical, 3 points if image optimization is missing, and 3 points if luxury product details (material origin, craftsmanship) are inadequate.

Check for features like quantity adjustment, product removal, price calculation, and persistent cart storage. Review if product variants (colors, sizes) are handled correctly. Deduct 5 points if the cart doesn't persist between sessions, 3 points if variant selection is buggy, and 5 points if the checkout flow is incomplete. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if there are fallbacks for failed image loading and retry mechanisms for API failures. Test edge cases like adding out-of-stock items or submitting incomplete forms. Code with strong robustness should handle these scenarios elegantly, giving 10 points. If robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no error handling exists, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to luxury fashion retail (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations that slow down browsing).

Check if the code follows WeChat Mini Program best practices using proper Custom Components. Deduct 5 points if global state management is chaotic; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear separation between presentation and business logic.
