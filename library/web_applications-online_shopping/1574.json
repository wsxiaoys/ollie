  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Make sure the code you provide is executable. I am a third-year student majoring in software technology, and I need to submit an assignment the day after tomorrow. I need something that can run successfully on my computer, so please help me create it and teach me how to download the software, configure it, and run it successfully to demonstrate the results.\n\nHere's what I've studied: 1. Using HTML and CSS to develop commercial websites 2. Introduction to programming 3. Linux basics 4. Object-oriented programming 5. MySQL database management 6. JavaScript programming 7. Database systems and applications 8. Dynamic website development (PHP) 9. HTML5+CSS3 development 10. WEB client-side development 11. Website construction and management. I need you to complete my requirements based on what I've learned. I'd like to use Vue and Bootstrap for the frontend, and for the backend, anything I've studied will work. For the content, I want to create a simple secondhand goods shopping website - the simpler the better.",

      "description": "Review whether the code implements essential e-commerce features: product listings with image display, category filtering, search functionality, and individual product detail pages. Check if Vue components are properly structured with props and event handling. Score 0 if these core features are absent, 5 if basic implementation exists but lacks refinement, and 10 if all features are fully functional with proper data binding.",

Check if proper validation is applied to forms, if password storage follows security best practices, and if session management is handled correctly. Deduct 3 points if validation is missing, 4 points if there's no password hashing, and 3 points if session persistence is not implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Verify if image upload functionality works and if form validation is present.

Check if proper relationships (foreign keys) are established, and if PHP/backend code uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to secondhand goods shopping (e.g., a built-in game) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., excessive animations). Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global variable pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no clear organization of files and dependencies.
