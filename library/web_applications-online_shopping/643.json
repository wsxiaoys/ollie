Develop an e-commerce product management system where customers can browse product listings on the frontend, view product details (including product name, price, inventory, description), and add products to their shopping cart. Merchants (username: seller, password: seller123) can log into the backend to add, delete, and modify product information, as well as process orders.",

Verify filtering and sorting capabilities (by price, category, popularity). The interface should support pagination or infinite scroll for large catalogs.
