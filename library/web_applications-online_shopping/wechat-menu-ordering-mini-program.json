  "question": "You are a code expert. Please use your professional knowledge to generate accurate and professional responses. Try to ensure the generated code is executable. I want to create a WeChat mini program. I'm a complete beginner with no knowledge at all. Now I need a piece of code to help me implement these functions: this is a menu mini program where I can freely add or remove dishes. Each dish needs to have an image, name, and description. Since there are many dishes, a search bar is necessary, and dishes need to be categorized, such as meat, hot dishes, cold dishes, etc. Please ensure the interface looks nice, not just plain white. I need a powerful mini program, please design it like restaurant ordering mini programs.",
