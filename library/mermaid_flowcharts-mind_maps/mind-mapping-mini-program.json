      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements node creation, deletion, editing, and hierarchical relationships through HTML/JavaScript/SVG. Must include drag-and-drop node positioning, parent-child relationship management, and dynamic branch connections. Score 0 if basic node operations are missing, 5 if only static node display is implemented, and 10 if full interactive mind mapping with real-time connection updates is achieved.",

Evaluate if connection points are accurately calculated and visually appealing. Deduct 5 points if connections don't follow nodes during drag operations, 3 points if line overlapping issues exist, and 5 points if connection algorithms cause performance issues.

Check if import functionality exists for data recovery. Deduct 5 points if only basic localStorage is used without proper data structure, 3 points if export formats are limited, and 5 points if no import/recovery mechanism exists.

Deduct 5 points if zoom/pan is not smooth or missing, 3 points if keyboard shortcuts are not implemented, and 5 points if node customization options are limited. Give 10 points if fully implemented with professional UX patterns.",

Code with strong robustness should effectively handle these edge cases and provide user-friendly error messages. Give 10 points for excellent error handling, 5 points for basic exception handling, and 0 points if no error handling exists.",

Template system with predefined mind map structures 3. Real-time collaboration features 4. AI-powered content suggestions 5. Advanced search and filtering). Add 2-3 points for each well-implemented innovative feature (maximum 10 points).",

Features unrelated to mind mapping core purpose (e.g., built-in games or social media integration) 3. Over-engineered animations that impact performance without adding value. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and deduct 10 points if redundant code interferes with core mind mapping functionality.",

Check for proper event handling, memory management, and performance optimization. Deduct 5 points for poor separation of concerns or spaghetti code structure; deduct 5 points if code duplication exceeds 25%; deduct 5 points for inefficient DOM manipulation or rendering bottlenecks.

Deduct 5 points for laggy animations during complex operations, 3 points for missing visual feedback on user actions, and 5 points for disorienting or excessive animations. Full score is 10 points.",
