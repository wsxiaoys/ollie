      "description": "Check whether the code correctly implements the fundamental calculations for Qi Men Dun Jia, including the 9 Stars (九星), 8 Gates (八門), 8 Gods (八神), Heavenly Stems (天干), Earthly Branches (地支), and their relationships. Verify if the code handles solar terms (節氣) and time divisions correctly. Score 0 if core calculations are incorrect, 5 if basic calculations are implemented but with minor errors, and 10 if all traditional Qi Men Dun Jia rules are accurately implemented.",

Check if the code manages the transitions between different Yuan (元) periods and handles the conversion between solar and lunar calendars correctly. Deduct 5 points if the temporal calculations are inconsistent with traditional methods, and 3 points if only basic timing systems are implemented. The full score is 10 points.",

Check for correct placement of elements (Stems, Branches, Stars, Gates, Gods) within the palaces according to traditional rules. Examine if the chart changes dynamically based on input time parameters. Deduct 5 points if the spatial arrangement is incorrect, and 3 points if the visual representation lacks clarity.

Check if it can identify important patterns like Du Mu He (遇墓解), Tian Yi He Jin (天乙合金), or San Qi Ju (三奇聚). Evaluate if the system offers interpretations for common divination questions (career, relationships, etc.). Deduct 5 points if interpretation functions are missing, and 3 points if they lack depth or cultural accuracy. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if the code validates Chinese calendar edge cases (e.g., leap months). Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Function modules unrelated to Qi Men Dun Jia (e.g., unrelated fortune-telling systems) 3. Fancy effects that affect performance (e.g., unnecessary animations that slow down chart generation).

Check if the code follows clear naming conventions that reflect traditional Qi Men Dun Jia terminology. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no separation between calculation logic and presentation.
