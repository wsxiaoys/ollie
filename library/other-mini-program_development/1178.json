      "description": "Review whether the code accurately implements a left-right distributed waterfall layout where cards dynamically fill columns based on height. Check if items are properly assigned to the shortest column first. Score 0 if the layout is not implemented, 5 if it's basic but has alignment issues, and 10 if it handles dynamic content heights perfectly with proper column balancing.",

Check if cards handle various content types (images, text, etc.) with proper aspect ratios and formatting. Deduct 3 points if images aren't optimized, 3 points if text overflow isn't handled, and 3 points if cards lack proper padding/margins. Full score is 10 points.",

Evaluate if it implements proper thresholds to trigger loading before reaching the bottom and includes loading indicators.

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",

Heavy animations that affect scrolling performance. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core waterfall functionality is compromised by redundant code.",

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if there's no separation between business logic and UI components.
