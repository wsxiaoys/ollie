Check if it uses appropriate methods (server-side rendering, headless browser solutions like Puppeteer, or external API services). Evaluate if the code handles timeouts, large pages, and authentication challenges. Deduct 5 points if there's no error handling for failed screenshot attempts, and 3 points if only a single screenshot method is supported without fallbacks. The full score is 10 points.",

Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
