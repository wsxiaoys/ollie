      "description": "Review whether the Java backend accurately implements time series analysis algorithms (such as ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet models) for power station operational trend prediction. Check if the code includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction validation. Score 0 if no prediction algorithm is implemented, 5 if only basic linear regression is used, and 10 if advanced machine learning models with proper validation metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) are fully implemented.",

Check if the system considers constraints like power demand, generation capacity, transmission limits, and cost optimization. Deduct 5 points if only basic rule-based scheduling is implemented, and 3 points if real-time constraint handling is missing. Full score requires multi-objective optimization with constraint satisfaction.",

Evaluate if interactive charts (using libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or Highcharts) allow users to drill down into historical data and future predictions. Deduct 5 points if visualizations are static, and 3 points if real-time data updates are not implemented. Full score requires interactive, responsive charts with proper data binding.",

Check if Angular services properly consume these APIs with error handling, loading states, and real-time updates. Deduct 5 points if API documentation is missing, and 3 points if no proper error handling between frontend and backend.

Code with strong robustness should include proper exception handling, data validation, and graceful degradation.

Function modules unrelated to power management (e.g., built-in social features) 3. Overly complex visualizations that affect performance (e.g., 3D animations without functional purpose).

Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found or design patterns are not used; deduct 5 points if code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if no automated testing or build pipeline is implemented.
